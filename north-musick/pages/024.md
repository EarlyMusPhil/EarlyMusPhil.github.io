&emsp;Graces in _Musick_ depend upon the same reason with the formality of a single Tune, and skilfully applyed do much advance it, by strengthning the memory of preceding, and the expectation of succeeding Notes, the doing whereof is left to every Player.

<dcap2></dcap2> 
THere are _Schismes_ in _Musick_, because the Scale is naturally fitted to one Key; and though it will indifferently serve to some others, yet it will not to all.
<br>
&emsp;The Scale of _Musick_ is not set out by any determinate quantities of whole Notes or half Notes, though the degrees are commonly so called; but the degrees in the Scale of _Musick_ are fixed by the Ear in those places, where the pulses of the _Tones_ are coincident, without any regard to the quantity. I shall endeavour to show how all the Notes come into the Scale by their relation and dignities; and then it will be obvious why for easiness of instruction and convenience the Scale of degrees of _Musick_ is made as the _Musicians_ now exhibit it.
<br>
&emsp;The Key Note being given, the first Note in dignity is the fifth above, which must have its true place; for whilst the Tune is in the Key, it has the greatest emphasis; and upon any digression from the Key, this Note is nearest to usurp it: and therefore when the Chords to the Key Note are placed, the Chords to this Note are to begarded, for without them there cannot be any variety, this being the first step from the Key.
<br>
&emsp;The other Chords to the Key are the third ♭ and ♯, the fourth and the sixth ♭ and ♯.
<br>
&emsp;The Chords to the fifth above the Key are the <fr><n>5</n>/<d>2</d></fr> <sup>d</sup>, and <fr><n>3</n>/<d>7</d></fr> <sup>th</sup> ♭ and ♯, which are the fifth and third ♭ and ♯ to that Note.
