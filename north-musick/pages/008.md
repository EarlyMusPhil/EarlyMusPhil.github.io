it proceeds from a _tone_, and the terms of the force are equal to the terms of vibration, every new stroke strengthens the former impression, and after some continuance the vibration of a Body affected by _Sound_, may become so great as to be sensible to the Eye and Ear.
<br>
&emsp;But where the terms of Vibration are not commensurate with the terms of concussion, the following pulses destroy the motion begun by the former, and the Vibration will never augment beyond what it was upon the first impression.
<br>
&emsp;Upon this Reason a string tuned in unison to another will manifestly shake when its fellow sounds, and another string that has a discording _Tone_, though of the same bigness, will not appear to be moved.
<br>
&emsp;And for this Reason, wheresoever the vibrations of two sounding strings are equal, the pulses will be coincident: for although one should set out after the other, yet by this affection they would by the second or third pulse become coincident.
<br>
&emsp;Where the terms are equal, and the coincidence is at every pulse, it may be said the same _Sound_ though proceeding from several Instruments: for the mixed _Sound_ has no alteration, but by being more loud and full by the addition.
<br>
&emsp;Where the Termes are 2 to 1, or 4 to 1, or 8 to 1, or 16 to 1, there will be coincidence to every pulse of the Base, and between those termes the treble is heard alone without any mixture: so that the _Sound_ is not changed but augmented by the addition of stronger pulses at proportionable intervalls, which makes the pulses superinduced appear of the same nature, though more grave or acute; this is the case of _Octaves_.
<br>
&emsp;Where the Termes are as 2 to 3, every third pulse of the Treble, and every other pulse of the Base are coincident, but the intermediate pulses, _sc._ 2 of the Treble, and 1 of the Base are not so, but keep certain distances, which makes the mixture produce an alteration: but the coincidences be
