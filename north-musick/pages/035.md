such other Notes as should bear an emphasis: and the other Notes that have the short or odd foot, seem but steps and passages to them, and indeed are so little regarded, that whether Chord or Discord they must be taken if they lye in the way. In the same manner, in all shaking graces the hovering is unequal betwixt two Notes, the advantage is given to the true Note, and the other has but faint touches, to make preparation for that which is to succeed.

&emsp;It is now time to put bounds to this Discourse, which by reason of the Method I engaged my self in, is become much longer than I intended; I will only add these Two Observations:

&emsp;1. It appears plainly how _Musick_ comes to be so copious: for considering the species of Keys, the number of them, the variety of Chords, the allowable mixing of Discords, the diversity of measure, it is not to be wondred at, that it should like Language afford to every Age, every Nation, nay, every Person, particular stiles and modes.

&emsp;2. It appears that _Tones_ or _Modes_ of _Musick_ in antient time could not be of other kinds than are now; for there can be no other in Nature: therefore the great effects it then had, if truly related, must be imputed to the rarity of it, and the barbarity of the People, who are not transported with any thing after it becomes common to them.
