frame of a Pipe, which chiefly consists in having a long slit through which the Air is blown in a thin film against or very near a solid edge that is at some distance opposite to it, in such manner that the intermediate space is covered by the stream of Air. This film of Air on the one side is exposed to the outward Air, and on the inside is defended from it by the sides of the Pipe, within which the Air inclosed in the Pipe stagnates, whilst the outward Air is by the blast put into a vortical motion.
<br>
&emsp;The vortical motion or Eddy on the outside is so strong, that there not being a balance to that force on the inside, the film of Air gives way, and the Eddy bears into the Pipe, but is immediately overcome by the blast, which prevails untill the Eddy overcomes it again; and so there is a crossing of streams by turns and pulses, which causes the voice of the Pipe, the gross Air of one stream being thrown off by the interposition of the other.
<br>
&emsp;These vicissitudes or termes will answer the _Tone_ of the Pipe according to the gage of its cavity: for the spring of the included Air helps toward the restitution of the blast and eddy in their turns, which causes those turns to comply with the _Tone_ of the Pipe; and therefore the same blast will cause several _Tones_, if the gage or measure of the included Air be changed by apertures in the side of the Pipe.
<br>
&emsp;But there must be some proportion between the mouth, (so I call that part of the Pipe where the voice is) and the gage of the Pipe: for though the pulses will be brought to comply with the _Tone_ of the Pipe in any reasonable degree, yet when there is great disparity it will not do so; as if the Pipe be too long for the proportion of the diameter, the pulses at the mouth cannot be brought to so slow termes as to answer the vibrations of the included Air, therefore the Pipe will not speak unless it can break into some higher Note. If the filmy stream of Air be too thick, the Pipe will not speak, because the eddy cannot break through; if the opposite edge be too remote, the stream cannot entirely cover
