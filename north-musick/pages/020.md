&emsp;Now if the Air that is moved by being inclosed stands upon such a degree of resistance to compression, that it has a spring vibrating in the same measure with the sound that puts it into motion, there will be the same effect as when two strings are tuned in unison, that is, the motion will be so augmented by succeeding regular pulses, that the enclosed Air may be brought to ring and produce a _Tone_.
<br>
&emsp;_Vitruvius_ in his _Architecture_ advises, that in making a _Theatre_ there should be vases or hollow pots of several sizes to answer all the Notes of _Musick_ placed upon the Stage in such manner, that the Voice of them which sang upon the Stage might be augmented by the ringing of them: And he mentions divers ancient _Theatres_ where such were, in some of _Brass_, in some of _Earth_.
<br>
&emsp;An _Organ-pipe_ of a very deep _Base_ will not speak suddenly when it is alone; but if an _Octave_ be in play at the same time, it will answer the quickest touch: because the _Tone_ of the lesser Pipe being in chord causes a motion of the Air included in the greater Pipe, and the vibrations of the included Air being coincident with those of the _Tone_ of the Pipe, promote its speaking by putting the pulses at the mouth into a regular motion, or at lest assisting thereto.
<br>
&emsp;These instances shew the manifest effects of _Sound_: and certainly _Sounds_ in discord are in contrariety, and offer violence one to another; but _Sounds_ in _Musical Chords_ are consistent, and united together, and promote each other, as I have before shewn in what I said concerning the Relation of _Tones_.
<br>
&emsp;The synchronous motion of the pulses at the mouth of the Pipe with the vibrations of the included Air promote the _Sound_ of the Pipe, and it is hard for a Pipe to speak where those motions are in opposition: but if by strengthning the blast the pulses at the mouth are so quickned that they bear a _Musical_ proportion to the vibration of the Air enclosed, as 2 to 1, 3 to 2, 4 to 3, 5 to 4, &c. there will be no hindrance but some advantage; so that it may be easily imagined
