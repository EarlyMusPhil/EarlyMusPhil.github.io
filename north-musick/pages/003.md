SIR,

<dcap3></dcap3>
<em>HAving often tyred you with Discourses of several Parts of Musick, wherein you desired to receive satisfaction, without obtaining the Effect I proposed to my self; I reflected upon the saying, That no man understands that which he cannot so express as to make another understand it, and doubted whether the Hypothesis I entertained were not founded upon Errours, which I had swallowed without any due examination. I resolved for tryal of it, to trace my Notions as near their Principles as I could, and set them down in method, that I might discover whether they were well deduced from one another, and from such Experiments as I had in memory. Having done this I send them to you, as the severest judge I know: It has not been your custome to flatter me, and now I desire your censure, if I may impose it upon you to give it in writing, wherein you will be obliged to quote what I say truly, before you object to it, and to stand to those Allegations and Inferences you will set down for your own, in both which respects I had great disadvantage in Discourse. I shall prevent you in condemning the stile, for being too contracted and obscure; and you must take the fault to your self when you know it does not proceed from the aversion I have to Philologie, but that I thought it would be labour lost to enlarge, when writing to so great a Philosopher and Musician as you are, I cannot fail of being understood.</em>
