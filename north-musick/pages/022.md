with the memory of the first: if the third Note be more in chord to the first, then is that remembrance continued and strengthned: if succeeding Notes are in discord, or of less relation to the Key Note, the mind and fancy is drawn from the Key Note by the present _Sound_; but by repeating the Key Note and its relatives with loudness and emphasis, the memory of the Key Note may be restored again.
<br>
&emsp;Thus in passing to and from the Key, by Notes that have relation to the preceding Notes may a Tune proceed to any length, and amuse the hearer: but when the fifth, which is the principal chord to the Key, and most strengthens the memory of it, comes in play, nothing can be more perfect and satisfie expectation but the Key Note it self, which gives a perfect acquiescence to the hearer, and a conclusion to the Tune.

&emsp;In the progress of a long Tune other Notes may gain so great impression in the mind by dwelling upon the relatives to them, that the first Key may be forgotten, and the same way new Notes may gain possession, so that the Key may change many times. Thus it is in long Fancies and Preludes, and it is no matter in such case what Key the Tune concludes in: but in short Airy Tunes there are but small digressions, leaning to the fifth or third, or other relative Notes, and sometimes suddenly closing upon them, which does not destroy the memory of the first Key Note, and therefore the Ear is not satisfied with such close, but expects another strain, which ending in the Key Note concludes the Song.
<br>
&emsp;Generally speaking, a Tune must begin and conclude in the Key Note, because that Note takes possession of the Ear; but this is not such a Rule but that sometimes a Tune begins or ends upon Notes relative to the Key; and the Key is shown by them, though it be not struck: as in the progress of a Tune the Key is to be traced by the relatives to it,
