&emsp;⅓ is as ⅔ 2 being the Octave to 1. 
<br>
&emsp;⅕ is as ⅘ 4 being in Octave to 1. 
<br>
&emsp;⅖ as ⅘, 2/6 as ⅔, ⅙ as 4/6, as ⅔. 
<br>
&emsp;And the eighth coincident pulse in a sixth flat, comes in upon this contemplation, but as the reverse of a third sharp, ⅝ being the reverse of 5/4, and the other sixth ⅗ is the reverse of 6/5. So that there can be no other coincidences under the distance of the seventh pulse, but what have the names of Chords, or the Octaves; and we are not to wonder why there are no more concording Notes.

WHerever a Body stands upon a Spring that vibrates in equal Termes, such a Body put into motion will produce a _Tone_, which will be more grave or acute, according to the velocity of the returns.
<br>
&emsp;Therefore strings vibrating have a _Tone_ according to the bigness or tension of them; and Bells that vibrate by cross ovals, produce Notes according to the bigness of them, or the thickness of their sides: and so do all other bodies whose superficies being displaced by force, results by a spring which carries it beyond its first station.
<br>
&emsp;It is easie to comprehend how every pulse upon such vibrations causes _Sound_, for the gross Air is thrown off by the violence of the motion, which continues some moment of time after the return of the vibrating Body, whereupon some space must be left to that subtil matter, which upon the result of the Air starts as from a Centre; which action being the same I supposed to be the cause of _Sound_, is repeated upon every vibration.
<br>
&emsp;It is more difficult to shew how _Tones_ are made by a Pipe, where there are no visible vibrations. I will consider the frame of a Pipe, and the motion of the Air in it, and there
