Spring, in taking such vibrations as are proportionable to the Cavity; It is a _Jews-harp_, or _Jews-trump_, the tongue whereof has natural vibrations according to strength and length of the Spring, and so is fitted to one particular Tone: But Countrey-men framing their breath and their mouth to several Notes make a shift to express a Tune by it.
<br>
&emsp;In a _Shawm_ or _Hautboys_ the Quill at the mouth is a kind of Spring, but so weak and indifferent that it complies with any measure, and therefore the _Tone_ will be according to the apertures of the Pipe.
<br>
&emsp;The fluttering and jarring of discording _Sounds_, which I before did observe, is so regular, and the _Sounds_ take their turns with equal interstices, which makes the joyning of them produce a harsher _Sound_ than either had before: whereby _Organ-makers_ imitate the _Hautboys_ or _Trumpet_, without any Spring or Quill, by joyning discording Pipes.
<br>
&emsp;In a _Sackbut_ the Lips of a Man do the same office as a Quill does in a _Shaume_ or _Hautboys_; when the included Air is lengthned, the _Tone_ varies: nevertheless they can produce several Notes that are in Chord to the _Tone_ of the Instrument, by strengthning the blast without lengthning the cavity: And in a _Trumpet_, which is the same kind of Instrument, (only not capable of being lengthned) they can sound a whole Tune, which is by the artificial ordering the blast at the mouth, whereby the _Sound_ breaks into such Notes as are to be used.
<br>
&emsp;This depends upon the consideration of the varying and breaking of _Tones_ into other Notes, whereof I am to speak particularly in my next Chapter, to which I hasten.
<br>
&emsp;Having shewed how _Tones_ are produced by Instruments of _Musick_, I must take notice of other assistances Instruments give to the _Sound_.
<br>
&emsp;In _Violins_ and _Harpsechords_ the _Tones_ are made wholly by the vibrating strings, but the frame of the Instrument adds much to the _Sound_: for such strings vibrating upon a flat rough board would yield but a faint and pitifull _Sound_.
