imagined that the pulses at the mouth in such case will receive no interruption by the included Air, but may maintain their stations, and produce a _Tone_ varying in the same proportion from the _Tone_ of the Pipe.
<br>
&emsp;It may be objected, that if it were so, there would be a mixture of _Sounds_; and not only the _Tone_ that is in chord to the _Tone_ of the Pipe would be heard, but also the _Tone_ of the Pipe with it.
<br>
&emsp;To which it may be answered, that the vibration of the included Air is not so considerable as to be heard distinctly, though it may give alteration to a _Sound_; as we see, that when a Pipe gives the true _Tone_, it speaks more in the belly than when it breaks into an Octave. But to wave that answer, perhaps when the Note breaks, the column of included Air divides into proportionable parts, by reason that the vibrating force at the mouth, and the resistance at the aperture meet one another in the middle, or upon other divisions, which will make the vibrations of the included Air coincident with every pulse at the mouth of the Pipe: which is the more probable, because a very small aperture in the middle of a Pipe will make it break into an eighth above, which seems not to happen by any diminution of the included Air, but interrupting the intireness of the Column.

BEfore any Note struck the Ear is indifferent to all _sounds_, but when any _Tone_ is heard, that indifferency is determined, and the mind taken up with the present _sound_. If the second Note be not of relation to the first, the imperssion made by the first will be wholly obliterated and forgotten, the _sounds_ will be disjoynted and incoherent: But if the second Note be of relation to the first, it is confistent
