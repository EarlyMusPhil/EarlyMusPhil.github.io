the aperture, for it mixes with the outward Air, and is more confused the farther it is from the vent or passage, whereby some outward Air may have communication to make an opposite eddy on the inside of the stream. For the same reason, if there be the least aperture in the region of the mouth of the Pipe, it will not speak at all.
<br>
&emsp;Hence is it, that the voice of Organ Pipes is so tender and nice: but shrill whistles depend not upon this ground; for they are made in any small cavity where the blast is so applyed, that the erumpent Air must cross it, whether the stream be thick or thin. Therefore the bore of a Key, a piece of nutshell, or any other cavity will make a whistle, whose _Tone_ will be according to the quantity of the included Air, for the less that is, the harder it is to be compressed, and the quicker and stronger it must break forth.
<br>
&emsp;Another kind of Whistle is, when a hollow body with a small cavity is perforated by opposite holes, a blast either way will cause a _Tone_, which seems to be made in this manner.
<br>
&emsp;The Air that is violently drawn or thrust through these holes is straitned at the passage by the swiftness of the motion, and within the cavity is somewhat enlarged, and consequently its force is directed, and it presses beyond the compass of the opposite aperture, whereupon it bears of all sides into the cavity; hereby the Air within the cavity is compressed untill it breaks forth by crossing the stream, which being done by vicissitudes causes a _Tone_: this kind of action, as I imagine, is performed when men whistle with their lips.
<br>
&emsp;In some Pipes the pulses are caused by springs, as the Regoll stop of an Organ, which is commonly tuned by shortning the spring whereby it becomes stronger, but the Note will be changed by the alteration of the cavity; and therefore to make them steddy, some that stand upon very weak springs have Pavelions set to them.

&emsp;A rustick instance may be given of the compliance of a
