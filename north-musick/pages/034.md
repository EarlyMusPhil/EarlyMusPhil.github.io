memory of the former, and if they do comprehend them, or are comprehended by them, it is alike pleasant, the mind cannot chuse but compare one with the other, and observe when the strokes are coincident with the memory of the former.

&emsp;Therefore the less the intervals are, the more grateful is the measure, because it is easily and exactly represented by the memory, whereas a long space of time that cannot be comprehended in one thought, is not retained in the memory in its exact measure, nor can abide the comparison, the time past being alwayes shortned by so much as it is removed from the time present.

&emsp;The modes of _Time_ are very few, being only in duple or triple proportion, and the diminishing is alwayes in Geometrical proportion, as two, four, eight, sixteen; that it might serve not only to the Basis of the _Time_, but also to the other intermediate degrees of diminution, which are in memory, if not in play.

&emsp;The triple can give two spaces to one, the duple can give three spaces to one, and although the duple or plain _Time_ seems to have spaces of even length, yet there is loudness and briskness given to every other pulse, which makes it eminent, and alwayes happens upon coincident strokes: this difference is between the fore-stroke and back-stroke in _Musick_, where the Notes are marked to be of an even length.

&emsp;These disparities of even and odd, and of two to one, and three to one are necessary, not only where _Time_ alone is regarded, as in a _Drum_, or upon a _Horn_, to show the coincident strokes; but in respect of _Musick_, for thereby length and loudness is given to the Key Notes, and
