by attempt to find the cause of the _Tone_ of a Pipe, and the pulse that gives the _Sound_.
<br>
&emsp;There is in any Pipe a Cavity of a certain gage or bigness which is exposed to the outward Air, but in some parts of it, and according to that Cavity is the _Tone_ of the Pipe.
<br>
&emsp;The Air in any Cavity being capable of being compressed by outward force, if the Cavity be large, easily yields to a compression; but if it be small, is more hardly compressed. When the compressing force ceases, the Body that was compressed with difficulty flies out with sudden violence; that which is more easily compressed restores it self not so soon: whereby it happens, that every Cavity has a certain _Tone_ according to the measure of the vibrations of the Air in it, which it will keep what way soever the force comes to it: As the water in a Shallow or Greek moved by the large waves of the Sea, retains not a motion in such huge waves, but in waves proportionable to its own bigness and depth.
<br>
&emsp;Hereupon I conclude, That any Pipe, whether made of Wood, Stone, Glass or Metal, has a certain and determinate _Tone_, according to its Gage and Cavity, which is the natural _Tone_ which will be produced by blowing it. If the Cavity be small, the _Sound_ will be acute, and may be made more acute by apertures, whereby the Cavity is diminished, and the inclosed Air exposed to the outward Air in greater measure.
<br>
&emsp;When I say, the _Tone_ is according to the proportion of the Cavity, let the Pipe be made of what it well; I do not deny but that if the materials of the Pipe be soft and yielding, it may give some small alteration to the _Tone_ from what it would be if they were of a substance hard and firm, where the impelling Air would find a more brisk resistance: but the difference is inconsiderable, and the spring of the Air depending mainly upon the greatness of the Cavity, I take no notice of it.
<br>
&emsp;To shew how the pulses are caused, whereby the included Air is put into this motion, it is necessary to observe the
