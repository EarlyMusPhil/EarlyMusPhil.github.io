&emsp;And there are allowances which the nature of the Parts require; the formality of the Treble must be airy and brisk, that of the Base slow and robust, the inner parts are generally employed to fill the _Musick_ with Chords, and have little curiosity of formality, except upon following a point: but these allowances considered, an expert _Musician_ will give a competent share of formality and sweetness to every part, making the Treble move in a grave pace, and the Base rest, that the beauty of the inner parts may be discerned.

&emsp;The third requisite of _Musick_ in Consort is _Conformity_ of all the parts: as the Formality of a single part requires, that the succeeding Notes should be agreeable to the former; so Conformity requires that each part should have the like tendency to the succeeding Notes.

&emsp;Which tendency is many times so regarded, that the present Harmony must yield to it: for if the succeeding Notes are of great relation to the Key, and the formal way to them in the several Parts is by discording Notes; nevertheless that way which gives so good expectation must not be balked, but rather the discords will be allowed, whose harshness is taken off by the expectation of the succeeding Chords, and the Harmony of the following Notes is the more welcome for the badness of the passage.

&emsp;Discords are allowed in _Musick_ upon this score, and they are also in other respects of excellent use; as when the mind is to be carried from any particular Note, it may be affronted by a discord; or if a Note in small esteem be to
