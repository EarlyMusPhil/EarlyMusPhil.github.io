&emsp;I suppose the air we breath in to be a mixture of divers minute bodies which are of different sorts and sizes, though all of them are so small as to escape our senses: the grosser of them are elastical, and are resisted by solid bodies, which are in no sort pervious to them; the smaller parts pass through solid bodies, but not with that ease but that upon a sudden and violent start of them, they shock the parts of solid bodies that stand in their way, and also the grosser parts of the air; and there may be another degree of most subtil Ethereal parts with which the interstices of these and all other bodies are repleat, which find freer passage every where, and are capable of no compression, and consequently be the medium and cause of the immediate communication of sight. The middle sort of these I esteem the medium and cause of _Sound_, and that at any time when the grosser air is driven off any space and leaves it to be possest by these and other more subtil bodies, and returns by its elasticity to its former place, then are these parts extruded with violence as from the center of that space, and communicate their motion as far as the sound is heard.
<br>
&emsp;Or when any solid body is moved with a sudden and violent motion, these parts must be affected thereby: for as these parts are so much resisted by solid bodies as to shock them, so on the contrary they must needs be moved by the sudden starting of solid bodies.
<br>
&emsp;So that sound may be caused by the tremble of solid bodies without the presence of gross Air, and also by the restitution of gross Air when it has been divided with any violence.
<br>
&emsp;We see a Bell will sound in the Torricellian space: and when the Air is divided with any sudden force, as by the end of a Whip having all the motion of the Whip contracted in it, and by a sudden turn throwing off the Air; by accension, as in Thunder and Guns; or by any impression of force carrying it where other Air cannot so forcibly follow, as upon compressing of Air in a bladder till it breaks, or in a Potgun, a sudden crack will be caused.
