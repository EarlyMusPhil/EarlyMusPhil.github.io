&emsp;By these divisions it appears, that the Tone above the Key, and that between the fourth and fifth, and that between the sixth and seventh, whether flat or sharp, are ninths of the string, which is called the _Tone Major_; the other _Tones_ are tenths of the String, and the natural _Semitones_ are sixteenths.
<br>
&emsp;Other _Semitones_ which are placed in the Scale, by the Rules before mentioned have other porportions, because neither _Tone Major_ nor _Tone Minor_ can he divided into sixteenths: therefore if one _Semitone_ be a sixteenth in a _Tone Major_, the other will be 19 2/7, and if one _Semitone_ be a sixteenth in a _Tone Minor_, the other will be a 25th, which is the _Somitone_ that naturally lies between a third ♭, and a third ♯. If a Tone Minor be so divided, that one Semitone is 25th of the string, the other will be 13 1/2.
<br>
&emsp;These unequall _Tones_ and _Semitones_ having their proper places in relation to the Key Note must needs produce Schismes upon displacing the Key Note. I shall give one instance: Suppose the Key Note a _Tone_ lower, which is at 400 upon the Monochord in the first Scheme, then by the present Scale the fifth should fall upon the fourth to the former Key, which is 270, but by the division of the Monochord 400/3 produces 133 ⅓, whose complement is 266 ⅔, so that the Schisme there is three and ⅓, which makes a vast difference, and is occasioned, because, whereas there should be two _Tones Major_, one _Tone Minor_, and a _Semitone_ to make a perfect fifth; this consists of two _Tones Minor_, one _Tone Major_, and a _Semitone_.
<br>
&emsp;It will be easie, by turning the _Octave Line_ divided into _Semitones_ into a _Circle_, and supposing the Key Note upon other _Semitones_, to find the differences of the _Tones_ and _Semitones_, that lye in order above it, from what they are in relation to the true Key Note, which will show more gross Disproportions or Schismes.

&emsp;Quarter Notes have been invented, which placed in those parts where these Schismes are the greatest, make the Instrument
