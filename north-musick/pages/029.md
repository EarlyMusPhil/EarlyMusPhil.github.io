stronger than those of the other parts, and so of more effect to maintain the coincidence; and for this reason, where a Tune begins with conjunct sounds, the Base is always the Key Note.
<br>
&emsp;Octaves as I have shewed before do not at all alter the sound, but only swell and fill it: for the sound has its quality from the terms of the interstices between the pulses; which if they are larger makes the sound more grave, if they be less, the sound is more acute: Now as in Division, the mode of the time is never alter'd by doubling the number of Notes in the same space of time, but the mind or memory couples them and comprehends them in the same space as if they were whole Notes; so is it by Octaves, being they increase by duplication of the pulses, in the same space of time it produces no alteration of the sound: And though there be Octaves above which are more acute, and Octaves below which are more grave, so that they differ from unisons; yet as to appearance they are the same, in respect of such difference as there is between other sounds; as if a man looks upon a Dye with the naked eye, and after should look upon it with a magnifying glass, though it appears bigger, yet by the figure and scituation he judges it the same.
<br>
&emsp;Therefore the _Musick_ is not changed but filled by adding Octaves above the upper parts: but Octaves below the upper parts that should come below the Base, would change the _Musick_, by changing the foundation and basis of it, to which all the Chords would have other relations than they had to the former.
<br>
&emsp;A fifth is the principal Chord (for the Octave cannot properly be called a Chord) in which there is an acquiescence; there being no other sound to which it can change to a more grateful one, and therefore is allowed in the close to fill the sound.
<br>
&emsp;A fourth by its coincidence of pulses should stand in the second place, but it is not allowed in _Musick_, according
