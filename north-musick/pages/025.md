&emsp;When the fifth has usurped the Key, the fifth above that must have the same emphasis, and will bring in the sharp fourth, or false fifth, which is its third sharp.
<br>
&emsp;The half Note above the Key is farthest from the Keys relatives, and therefore the _Sound_ of it removes the dominion of the Key Note farther off than any other; the nearest way of bringing it in request is when the fifth below has usurped the Key, to which it is a sixth flat: The fifth below taking the Key makes an ingratefull remove, for it is not a Chord comprehended in the Key Note, but the Key Note is comprehended in that, and so it diminishes the regard to the Key Note more than any other, making the transition to the Key Note, not as a restitution, but as a digression to a secondary Key, which should not continue.
<br>
&emsp;These are all the Notes of the Scale within the compass of an Octave, and by this method should they be Tuned, _Viz._ Third ♭ and third ♯, fourth, fifth, sixth ♭, and sixth ♯, by the Key Note, second and seventh ♭, and seventh ♯ by the fifth above the Key or its Octave; false fifth or fourth ♯ must be third ♯ to the second, and the ½ Note above the Key must be a sixth ♭ to the fifth below the Key.
<br>
&emsp;An Instrument thus tuned will be exact to that one Key, and serve to play Tunes in that Key; but when the _Musick_ turns to other Keys that are not relative to it, the divisions and degrees that fitted the first Key will not sute with the others, but must be removed, and thereby the _Schismes_ appear, without which the Notes which ought to be principal and most perfect Chords to the new Key, will be manifestly out of Tune.
<br>
&emsp;This will best appear upon view of the division of the Monochord, which I have set down in the plainest manner I could frame.
