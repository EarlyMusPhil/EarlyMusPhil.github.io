to the sweetness of its sound, because its Octave below the Base mends the Harmony so much, that it cannot be kept out of mind, but will be desired and expected: and therefore a fourth is a binding Note that strongly induces a close in the fifth below. So that a fourth is not for its sweetness allowed to be a Chord by most _Musicians_, because it is not stable but subservient to a change, which change is more induced, because only a sixth can be joyned with it, which will be a third to the fifth below, and so increases the expectation of a change.

&emsp;A third sharp is a Chord so gratefull that it is allowed in the close to fill the sound; it being in Chord to the fifth bears it company, and its Octave to reverse would change the _Musick_ into a sixth flat, which is the least pleasing of all Chords, and therefore is not at all regarded; but the mind acquiesces in the third sharp.

&emsp;A third flat, nor the sixth flat nor sharp, claim not any place in the close, because they are in discord to the third sharp and fifth, so that both cannot be allowed, and the other are preferred: but they are in the body of a Tune very gratefull Chords that never offend the ear, nor do they invite any change by their Octaves below the Base, but afford a stable and pleasant Harmony.

&emsp;I shall not speak of discording _Tones_ which are often conjoyned in Musick, because they are not allowed for their own sake, but for reasons which will appear in what I have further to say concerning Consort.

&emsp;Wherein the second requisite is _Formality_, which every part ought to have, though not to that degree of pleasantness that is expected from a single Tune, yet in a reasonable degree.
