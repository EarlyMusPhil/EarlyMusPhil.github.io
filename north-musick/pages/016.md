&emsp;The help that Instruments give to the _Sound_, is by reason that their sides tremble and comply with any _Sound_, and strike the Air in the same measure that the vibrations of the _Musick_ are, and so considerably increase the _Sound_.
<br>
&emsp;This trembling is chiefly occasioned by the continuity of the sides of the Instrument with the vibrating string: therefore if the bridge of a _Violin_ be loaded with lead, the _Sound_ will be damp; and if there be not a stick called the _Sound-post_ to promote the continuity between the back and belly of the Instrument, the _Sound_ will not be brisk and sprightly.
<br>
&emsp;Such a continuity to the nerve of hearing will cause a sense of _Sound_ to a man that hath stopped his ears, if he will hold a stick that touches the sounding Instrument between his teeth.
<br>
&emsp;The _Sound_ of it self without such continuity would occasion some trembling, as may be seen by the moving the _Unison_ strings in the Instance before given; but this is not considerable in respect of the other, though it be all the assistance that the structure of a Chamber can give to _Musick_, except what is by way of Eccho.
<br>
&emsp;This tremble of the Instrument changes with every new _Sound_; the spring of the sides of the Instrument standing indifferent to take any measure, receives a new impression: but a vibrating string can take no measure but according to its tension.
<br>
&emsp;Therefore Instruments that have nothing to stop the _sounding_ strings make an intolerable jangle to one that stands near, as Bells to one that is in the Steeple, and hears the continuing _Sound_ of dissonant _Tones_; such is the _Dulcimer_: but the _Harpsechord_ that hath raggs upon the jacks by which the vibration of the string is staid, gives no disturbance by the sonorousness of the Instrument, for that continues not the _Sound_ after the vibrations determined, and another _Tone_ struck, but changes and complies with the new _Sound_.
