<em>In other things I expose it to you; and if I shall receive plain Confutations, it will not much disappoint or mortifie me: for I have hardly in my whole Life made one set experiment upon this Subject, nor know many of the Instruments I have spoken of: But what I heard from others, or occasionally observed, I laid up in mind, and established this Systeme, which I shall be glad to lose, if I may improve my Knowledge by your Discoveries. This may seem strange to you, considering how fond men are of their own Inventions: At the worst, I hope for this fruit of my pains, that you will make such Experiments as your Curiosity will suggest whilst you read this, and let me know the success of them; though I may thereby be driven out of his Hypothesis, perhaps I shall receive light towards another, which you may believe I shall take as much pleasure in making, as you, or any body else can to destroy.</em>

I am, SIR,

<right>Your most Faithfull Friend&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>and Servant.</right>
