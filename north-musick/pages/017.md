_TOnes_ will by accident vary and break into other _Tones_, which are Chords to the natural _Tone_ of the Instrument: which in Pipes is so regular, that the compass of the _Musick_ depends upon it; upon Strings it will happen, but not so gratefull to the ear, nor much in use. I will endeavour to explain how it is caused in Strings, and speak of Pipes afterwards.
<br>
&emsp;A perfect string produces a clear _Sound_ by entire and equall vibrations, there being no inequality to hinder the motion from being uniform from one end to the other, according to the Laws of a _Pendulum_: but if the string hath any inequality towards one end, it will yield a jarring and distracted _Sound_; for the resistances are not only at the ends of the string, but there are cross _tugges_ that alter the course of the vibrations; which is evident in the manner whereby _Musicians_ try if their strings be true: for if the string be true the vibrations will appear as a clear filme; but they will appear with cross threads if the string be false.
<br>
&emsp;If there be a long string _Pendulum_, the motion will be uniform and synchronous from the bottom to the top: but if there be a weight fastned to the string towards the top, it will hinder the regularity of the motion; for the upper weight will be put into motion, and will have vibrations of its own, which will be mixed and confounded with the vibrations of the lower weight. In the same manner in a false string two or more sorts of vibrations are blended, which are not in proportion, but casual and discording, and therefore instead of a _Tone_ produce an horrible jarr.
<br>
&emsp;Now as a string by such small accidents is brought to vibrations of several parts of the string that hold no proportion one to another, much more easily may it be imagined to have vibrations of uniform parts, that shall be synchronous
