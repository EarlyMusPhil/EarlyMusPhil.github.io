INTRODUCTION

CHATPER I
LEONHARD EULER

Life

Euler was born on April 15, 1707, in Basel, Switzerland, which was the home of the Bernoullis, a famous family of scientists and mathematicians. His father was a Calvinistic pastor who was also a mathematician. both son and father studied under members of the Bernoulli family.

The elder Euler initially hopped that his son would follow in his footsteps and become a minister, but he soon abandoned this dream and sent Leonhard to study mathematics under Jean Bernoulli at the University of Basel. He also studied theology, oriental languages, medicine, astronomy, and physics.

In 1727 he left Basel for St. Petersburg and in 1730 he obtained the Chair of Natural Philosophy at the Imperial Academy. The _Tentamen novae theoriae musicae_ was published during this stay in St. Petersburg. In 1735 he suffered the loss of sight in his right eye, but his enormous output of mathematical and scientific works continued unabated. He commented about this loss, "J'aurai moins de distractions."<fn>Smith, D. E., _History of Mathematics_, p. 251.</fn>
In 1741 Euler accepted an invitation from King Frederick the Great to come to Berlin. He joined the Berlin Academy and remained for twenty-five years. In 1766 he returned to St. Petersburg, where he lived until his death on September 18, 1783. He became completely blind in 1771 but he continued to dictate his memoirs to his children and pupils.

> Magnificent work it was too, astonishing at once for its labour and its originality. He developed an amazing facility for figures, and that rare gift of mentally carrying out far-reaching calculations. It is recorded that on one occasion when two of his pupils, working the sum of a series to seventeen terms, disagreed in their results by one unit, at the fiftieth significant figure, an appeal was made to Euler. He went over the calculation in his own mind, and his decision was found to be correct. <fn>Turnbull, H. W., "The Bernoullis and Euler," in _The World of Mathematics_, edited by James R. Newman, pp. 149-150.</fn>

Although Euler's most important work was done in pure mathematics, he was a man of wide culture. He was interested in many branches of applied mathematics and science, and he was an excellent classical scholar with extensive knowledge of general literature. It is said that he could repeat Virgil's _Aeneid_ from memory and could give the first and last lines of each page of the edition which he used, "but such lines from Virgil, as 'The anchor drops, the rushing keel is staid,' always suggested to him a problem and he could not help enquiring what would be the ship's motion in such a case."<fn>Finkel, B. F., "Leonhard Euler," _The American Mathematical Monthly_, IV (1897), 300.</fn>

Works

In 1909 the Swiss Society of Natural Sciences undertook the gigantic project of publishing the complete works of Euler, "the most prolific of mathematicians."<fn>Courant, Richard, and Robbins, Herbert, _What is Mathematics?_, p. 21.</fn> This continuing project has produced about fifty large volumes. The total number anticipated is variously estimated from 80 to 100. The publication is divided into four parts: Series I, mathematics; Series II, mechanics and astronomy; Series III, physics and miscellaneous works;<fn>Series III, Volume 1, contains Euler's writings on sound and music, including the _Tentamen_.</fn> and Series IV, notebooks and correspondence.

Turnbull describes Euler, the matician, thus:
> In an untechnical account it is impossible to do justice to the mathematics of Euler: but while Newton is a national hero, surely Euler is a hero for mathematicians. Newton was the Archimedes and Euler was the Pythagoras. Great was the work of Euler in the problems of physics--but only because their mathematical pattern caught and retained his attention. His delight was to speculate in the realms of pure intellect, and here he reigns a prince of analysts. Not even geometry, not even the study of lines and figures, diverted him: his ultimate and constant aim was the perfection of the calculus and analysis. . . . The full splendour of the early Greek beginnings and the later works of Napier, Newton and Leibnitz, was now displayed.<fn>Turnbull, _op. cit._, p. 150</fn>

His mathematical achievements are concisely expressed in the statement that "mathematics through the calculus as we know it today was shaped largely by the hand of Euler."<fn>Lasley, J. W., "Mathematics and the Sciences," in _Mathematics: Our Great Heritage_, p. 176.</fn>


Chapter II
_THE TENTAMEN NOVAE THEORIAE MUSICAE_

Original and Subsequent Editions

The _Tentamen novae theoriae musicae_ is the major treatise on music of Leonhard Euler (1707-1783), generally recognized as one of the truly great mathematicians of all time. The extent of Euler's accomplishments in mathematics and science has been outlined.

As a music theorist Euler has been given attention by such writers as Helmholtz, Riemann, Lang, Shirlaw, Jeans, Pole, Bukofzer, Van der Pol, and many others. The _Tentamen_ is mentioned frequently, but in most cases no attempt is made to describe its contents. It is the purpose of this study to provide a wider access to Euler's ideas by means of a faithful, integral English translation of the _Tentamen_. 

The _Tentamen_ was first published in 1739 in St. Petersburg, Russia, where Euler was a professor at the Imperial Academy of Sciences. This Academy was brought into being by Catherine I.

In 1752 Lorenz Chirstoph Mizler<fn>Mizler (1711-1778) also founded the _Societät der musikalischen Wissenschaften_ in Leipzig in 1738. Bach and Telemann were members. Scinece the Society wanted to reform music by drawing up a system of musical science, Mizler's deep interest in Euler's theory is not surprising.</fn> began a German translation from the original Latin in his _Neu erröffnete musikalische Bibliothek_, one of the earliest music periodicals. When publication ceased in 1754, only thep reface and first four chapters of the translation had appeared.

A French translation, _Musique mathématique_, appeared in 1865 in Paris. The translator is anonymous. Archibald<fn>Archibald, R. C., "Mathematicians and Music," _The American Mathematical Monthly_, XXXI (1924), 22.</fn> mentions another French edition in 1839.

In 1926 a new edition of the original appeared as part of the publication of Euler's complete works under the auspices of the Swiss Society of Natural Sciences. The editor was Eduard Bernoulli. The present translation was made from this edition, which is substantially a reprint of the original Latin version. Original editions are to be found in several libraries in the United States and are often listed in the catalogs of rare book dealers. The existing number of copies seems to support Pole's statement that the _Tentamen_ "found general favor during the last century."<fn>Pole, William, _The Philosophy of Music_, p. 206.</fn>
	
E. T. Bell introduces his translation of Euler's proof that every integer is a sum of four squares with the statement that "the effort has been made to give a free translation that shall clearly convey Euler's meaning, in preference to following too closely the rather poor Latin of the day."<fn>Smith, D. E., _A Source Book in Mathematics_, p. 91.</fn> This procedure has been followed in the present translation. For the most part, Euler is careful to define his terminology, but words and definitions are encountered which are to be found neither in classical Latin dictionaries nor in later dictionaries. In some cases the context provided the answer. In others, an abridged English dictionary provided closely corresponding words with meanings germane to the context. Obsolete units of measurement presented some difficulty. The French translation, _Musique mathématique_, provided solutions to many problems.

Background and Purpose

In his preface to the _Tentamen_ Euler has outlined his purpose, main ideas, and plan of treatment. Euler had almost completed the Tentamen in 1731, about eight years before publication. This information plus a succinct statement of purpose is contained in a letter<fn>The letters are quoted by Archibald, _op. cit._, p. 22.</fn> written in May, 1731, to Daniel Bernoulli:<fn>Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782) and Euler were pioneers in the development of the mathematical theory of pipes and vibrating strings.</fn>

> My main purpose was that I should study music as part of mathematics and deduce in an orderly manner, from correct principles, everything which can make a fitting together and mingling of tones pleasing. In the whole discussion I have necessarily had a metaphysical basis, wherein the cause is contained why a piece of music can give one pleasure and the basis for it is to be located, and why a thing to us pleasing is to another displeasing.

Bernoulli's reply as follows:

> I cannot readily divine wherein that principle should exist, however metaphysical i may be, whereby the reason could be given why one could take pleasure in a piece of music, and why a thing pleasant for us, may for another be unpleasant. One has indeed a general idea of harmony that it is charming if it is well arranged and the consonances are well managed, but, as it is well known, dissonances in music also have their use since by means of them the charm of the immediately following consonances is brought out the better, according to the common saying _opposita juxta se posita magis elucescunt_ [opposites placed together shine brighter]; also in the art of painting, shadows must be relieved by light.

Nicolas Fuss, eighteenth century mathematician, said that the _Tentamen_ "had no great success, as it contained too much geometry for musicians, and too much music for geometers."<fn>Moritz, R. E., _On Mathematics and Mathematicians_, p. 156.</fn>

Euler's deep interest in vibrating bodies, acoustics, and music began early in his life. His first publication in these areas was a dissertation on sound which appeared in 1727. The last appeared some sixty years later. His notebook sketch<fn>See Appendix A</fn> for a special treatment of music apparently was made in 1726 when Euler was nineteen. It is only an outline, but it is evidence that Euler was well acquainted with the music literature of his day. Further evidence of his interest in music is found in his well known series of letters, or lessons, on natural philosophy, addressed to a German princess, the Princess of Anhalt Dessau.

Content

_Sound_. Euler was recognized in his day as an authority on acoustics, and he was thus eminently qualified to begin his treatis on music with a summary in Chapter I of the "principles of sounds and hearing which constitute the material upon which music depends." The basic principles, as he presents them, are generally correct.

A unique feature of this summary is his formula in Section 9 for the frequency of a vibrating string:

[equation to be edited]

Here _a_ is the length of the string and _n_ is the ratio of the stretching weight to the weight of the string. 3166 represents the length in thousandths of a Rhenish foot a pendulum which takes one second for one oscillation. Today such a pendulum is called a seconds pendulum, and its length, 39.117 inches at sea level, lat. 45°, is a well-known physical constant. A. J. Ellis gives the following logarithmic form of the formula:

2 log V = 1.98485 + log W - (log w + log L).

Here _L_ is the string length, _W_ the stretching weight in any unit, _w_ the weight of the strong in the same unit, and _V_ the pitch number.<fn>Helmholtz, Herman L. F., _On the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music_, p. 441. Ellis was the translator.</fn> 

It should be noted that Euler's formula requires only the simplest of measurements: weight and length. The usual formulas in modern physics texts for the frequency of a vibrating string are

[equation]

and 

[equation]

where _L_=length, _T_=tension, _m_=mass per unit length, _d_=density, and _r_=radius. It is not known how Euler developed his formula.

_Euphonic Values_. Euler lists three attributes of music capable of conveying agreeableness: (1) pitch, (2) duration, and (3) intensity. The _Tentamen_ consists chiefly of a classification of euphonic values under the first of these categories. Euler hints that such a treatment of duration could be made along the same lines, but he does not pursue this subject. The element of intensity, not lending itself easily to quantification, is not investigated. 

The principle features of Euler's classification are found in Chapter II. For him all combinations of tones are consonances, but such combinations may be classified under various _degrees of agreeableness_. Euler's point of departure is a psychological one. The whole structure of classification is erected on the basis of the ratios of the unison, octave, twelfth, and double octave, represented respectively by the ratios 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4. The unison, classified as the most agreeable interval, belongs to the first degree of agreeableness. The octave, 1:2, belongs to the second degree. 1:3 and 1:4 receive and equal ranking and are assigned to the third degree. This established an inductive pattern. (See Section 23 and the succeeding portion of Chapter II.) The least common multiple of the numbers representing the pitches of a succession of tones, a chord, a succession of chords, or any group of tones, has a unique degree of agreeableness. Euler calls this least common multiple an _exponent_. 

For example, consider the major triad with the tones in the ratio 4:5:6. The least common multiple of these numbers is 60. The table in Section 31, Chapter II, shows that this assigns the triad to the ninth degree of agreeableness. however, the table is not absolutely necessary since in Section 6, Chapter IV, Euler shows how to find the degree by use of the formula _s_ - _n_ + 1, where _s_ is the sum of the prime factors of the exponent and _n_ is the number of these factors. The factors of the exponent of 60 may be exhibited as 2²·3·5, where _s_ = 12 and _n_ = 4.Thus, _s_ - _n_ + 1 = 9.

Sir James Jeans' comments are of particular interest here:

> In 1738 the mathematician Euler attempted an explanation on the psychological lines, saying that the human mind delights in law and order, and so takes pleasure in discovering it in nature. The smaller the numbers required to express the ratio of two frequencies, the easier it is--such was his argument--to discover this law and order, and so the pleasanter it is to hear the sounds in question. Euler went so far as to propose a definite quantitative measure of the dissonance of a chord. his plan was to express the frequency ratio of the chord in question by the smallest numbers possible, and then to find the smallest number into which all these could be divided exactly. This last number, he thought, gave a measure of the dissonance of the chord. For example, the frequency ratio of the notes of the common chord C E G c' is 4:5:6:8. The measure of dissonance is accordingly 120, since this is the smallest number of which 4, 5, 6, and 8 are all factors. 
> It is easy to criticise this theory from all sides. In the first place it fails to explain the facts, since it assigns the same measure of dissonance, 120, to the chord of the seventh C E G B (with frequency ratios 8:10:12:15) as to the far less dissonant common chord. Again if we put one note, say E, out of tune by one per cent of its frequency (about sixth of a semitone) we increase Euler's measure of dissonance 100-fold; if we now reduce the out-of-tuneness to a tenth of this, we increase the measure of dissonance another tenfold. If one note is only infinitesimally out of tune, the measure of dissonance at once shoots up to infinity, which is a complete _reductio ad absurdum_. Finally, Euler's theory fails to explain why we enjoy hearing the common chord, with its 120 units of annoyance, we could reduce the annoyance to 24 units by dropping E out of the chord, and could eliminate the annoyance altogether by sitting in silence.<fn>Jeans, Sir James, _Science & Music_, pp. 155-156.</fn>

Euler might reply that his classification actually assigns degrees of _agreeableness_ to consonances, since he considered any combination of tones a consonance. As to intonation, Euler makes it clear that he considers perfect tuning impossible and concedes that the ear has some flexibility in this matter (but not enough to justify equal temperament). Also, Euler makes clear that music should have much variety and that the highest agreeableness does not lie in simplicity. 

_Musical Logarithms_. Cajori states that "the miraculous powers of modern calculation are due to three inventions: the Arabic Notation, Decimal Fractions, and Logarithms."<fn>Cajori, Florian. _A History of Mathematics_, p. 49.</fn> A logarithm is actually exponent which indicates the power to which some number called the _base_ must be raised to yield the given number. A frequently used base is 10. Since 10²=100, we say the logarithm of 100=2. In like manner, the logarithm of 100 is 3. If we have the product of 100 and 100, it can be written thus: 10²·10³=10⁵. Thus 5 is the logarithm of the product. The important thing here is that the product is found by _multiplication_ but the logarithm is of the product is found by _addition_. This fact is useful to musicians in adding or subtracting musical intervals since the logarithms corresponding to the intervals may also be added or subtracted to find the logarithm of the resulting interval.

If 10, 2, and 12root(2) are used successively as bases, the corresponding logarithmic measurements of the octave, 2:1, would be .30103, 1.00000, and 12.00000. The last base, 12root(2), is useful in the case of equal temperament, since here the semitone ratio is 12root(2):1. Using 1200 _cents_ to correspond to 12, A. J. Ellis (1814-1890) was able to represent the various tones of the chromatic scale in equal temperament by multiples of 100 cents. This useful logarithmic measurement can also be applied to intervals other than those found in equal temperament. Logarithms are also useful in determining the approximate decimal value of such an expression as 12root(2).

Logarithms were invented independently in the seventeenth century by John Napier, a Scotsman, and by Joost Burgi, a Swiss.

Guy Warrack states that in the _Tentamen_ Euler made the first use of logarithms to show differences of pitch.<fn>Warrack, guy, "Music and Mathematics," _Music and Letters_, XXVI (1945), 22.</fn> Other writers and various standard reference books on music also give Euler this credit. Actually, Euler was preceded in this matter by at least two men. Archibald credits Christian Huygens (1629-1695), who used musical logairthms in his publication "Novus cyclus harmonicus" in _Opera varia_, 1724.<fn>Archibald, op. cit., p. 17.</fn> Barbour lists the inventor of musical logairthms as Bishop Juan Carmel de Lobkowitz (1606-1682), who used them in his _Mathesis nova_, 1670. <fn>Barbour, J. M., _Tuning and Temperament_, p. 3. See also Barbour, "Musical Logairthms," _Scripta Mathematica_, VII (1940), 21-31.</fn> In comparing logarithms of the fifth and the octave in the _Tentamen_, Euler used a continued fraction for the first time for such purpose.<fn>_Tentamen_, Section 38, Chapter IV.</fn>

_Euler and Seven_. The following definition is taken from a dictionary of 1795:

> _Musical numbers_, are the numbers 2, 3 and 5, together with their composites. They are so called, because all the intervals of music may be expressed by such numbers. This is now generally admitted by musical theorists. Mr. Euler seems to suppose, that 7 or other primes might be introduced; but he speaks of this as a doubtful and difficult matter. Here 2 corresponds to the octave, 3 to the fifth, or rather, to the 12th, and 5 to the third major, or rather the seventeenth. From these three may all other intervals be found.<fn>Hutton, Charles, _A Mathematical and Philosophical Dictionary_, Vol. II, pp. 136-137. Punctuation of the original definition is retained.</fn>

This definition is, in a sense, a synopsis of the _Tentamen_, since for Euler "true harmony" lay in the ratios of the whole numbers, specifically, the ratios of "musical numbers," their powers and their products. The author of the definition, however, apparently had not read two later papers by Euler in which he decided that acceptance of seven, in theory, if not in fact, was the way out of rather distressing dilemmas created in the _Tentamen_. The two brief papers are _Conjecture sur la raison de quelques dissonances généralement reçues dans la musique_ and _Du véitable caractère de la musique moderne_, both of which appeared in 1764.

In the _Tentamen_ Euler assigns the dominant seventh to the sixteenth degree of agreeableness and classifies it as "unbearable" as an entity.<fn>See Section 29, Chapter XIII.</fn> About twenty-five years after the _Tentamen_ appeared, after he had undoubtedly observed composers' predilection for the dominant seventh, he wrote the brief _Conjecture_ in which he attempts an explanation for the acceptance of the chord. Representing it by the ratio 36:45:54:64 and conceding the hearing more flexibility than he did in the Tentamen, he says that the ear substitutes 63 in place of 64, so that the ratio becomes 36:45:54:63, or 4:5:6:7, which is easier to perceive. He also says that the hearing must make such substitutions for the irrational ratios of equal temperaments, which is rejected in the _Tentamen_, as one would expect, since his theory rests on the ratios of whole numbers. However, it must have occurred to Euler by the time of the _Conjecture_ that equal temperament would hardly have strained the hearing more than some of the common consonances in his own diatonic-chromatic genus, a variant of just intonation which he devised in the hope of achieving maximum agreeableness.<fn>See Appendix B.</fn>

In his _Du véitable caractère de la musique moderne_ Euler states that his recognition of the number 7 is the distinguishing characteristic of the music of his day. Fétis said that Euler was "the first to see that the character of modern music resides in the chord of the Dominant Seventh, and that its determining ratio is that of the number 7."<fn>Shirlaw, Matthew, _The Theory of Harmony_, p. 348</fn>

Euler is thus included with Mersenne, Tartini, Fétis, Serre, Hauptmann, Ellis, Perrett, and others who have advocated extension of Zarlino's _senario_, 1:2:3:4:5:6, to including 7. Zarlino, Desartes, Rameau, Helmholtz, Ottigen, Riemann, and Hindemith have opposed this extension.<fn>Partch, Harry, _Genesis of a Music_, p. 93.</fn>

In the _Tentamen_, Section 20, Chapter X, after giving his reasons for rejecting seven, Euler includes a table for the genus with an exponent of 2ᵐ·3²·5²·7. In modern times, with Euler's genus in mind, A. D. Fokker has constructed an experimental organ in Haarlam, Holland, in the Teyler Museum.<fn>Fokker, A. D., "Expériences musicales avec les genres musicaux de Leonhard Euler contenant le septième harmonique," _International Gesselschaft für Musikwissenschaft, Kongressbericht_, pp. 113-115.</fn> This organ permits hearing such genera as 3·5·7, 3·3·7, 3·7·7, 5·5·7, 5·5·7, 7·7·7.

PART TWO

ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF THE _TENTAMEN NOVAE THEORIAE MUSICAE_

AN ATTEMPT AT A NEW THEORY OF MUSIC BASED ON CORRECT PRINCIPLES OF HARMONY AND CLEARLY EXPOUNDED BY THE AUTHOR

LEONHARD EULER


PREFACE

In those earliest times in which music began to be cultivated, those things by which music is rendered pleasing to the hearing and by which it affects the spirit with delight were quite clearly understood neither to lie in the judgment of men nor to depend on custom. Pythagoras, who first considered the foundations of music, knew that the basis of consonances by which the ears are pleased is concealed in perceptible proportions, even if it was not yet clear to him how these ratios were understood by the hearing. But since he had observed less clearly the true principles of harmony, he had attributed too much to his proportions and had not learned to establish actual limits of indebtedness to them. For that reason he was justly criticized by Aristoxenus, who, in order to combat the principle of Pythagoras, fell back too much upon an opposite viewpoint, as he strove to remove all power of numbers and ratios from music. Yet, not even Aristoxenus dared to assert that a well-composed melody is pleasing to the ears simply from chance and without any reason; but he denied that so much of the reason for musical pleasure lay in the proportions fixed by Pythagoras. And, while he thought all judgment of consonances remained for the ears, he chose to ignore the very source rather than to admit Pythagoras' principle, insufficient and hitherto involved in many errors. Indeed, today one might have even more justification for doubting whether _any_ music theory exists which can explain why any melody pleases or displeases; for not only do we abhor the music of barbarians, which usually is extraordinarily pleasing to them, but these barbarians, on the other hand, find nothing at all agreeable in our music. But if anyone wishes to conclude that there is no basis at all for the agreeableness which music gives us, he would be making a hasty judgment. Since a musical composition of this period may be composed of innumerable parts, honest judgment begins with careful observation and examination of single component parts, not with the barbarians' aversion or our approbation. If we begin our judgment with the simplest consonances of which all music is composed; octaves, fifths, fourths, thirds, and sixths, major and minor, we discover no disagreement among all peoples; but rather, by unanimous consent, all of these intervals are considered more pleasing to the hearing than the dissonances, namely, the tritone, sevenths, seconds, and innumerable others which can be formed. Since no reason is offered and since it cannot be ascribed to custom alone, the true cause of this consensus well deserves investigation. There follows, in almost the same way, the consideration of two or more consonances in succession whose connection without system can neither please nor displease. But more attention and skill is required for obtaining enjoyment from several successive consonances than from single, isolated ones; for, in order that single consonances may please, it is sufficient if they are understood, and the order, which is contained within themselves, is perceived; but if several consonances are presented successively, it is especially necessary for pleasing results that the order contained in the sequence be understood. But if the multiplicity of these things, in which a certain order exists, is so greatly increased that the order can be perceived only by the most sensitive ears, it is no wonder if duller ears find no agreeableness at all. Therefore, when barbarians get little or no enjoyment from our music, it does not follow that either no agreeableness exists at all or that it pleases us because of familiarity alone, but rather it should be concluded that there is far more order and agreeableness in our music, of which only the least part is perceived by the barbarians. But familiarity in this matter is most valuable, certainly not for persuading anyone that a certain musical composition is pleasing, which is displeasing to others, but for exercising and sharpening the auditory sense itself, so that it can perceive all orders with which such music is filled. The most elementary music, by its great simplicity, affects us with aversion because we are accustomed to richer compositions and to looking for much more order; and this music should be left to those who do not yet exercise and perfect their ears in this manner.

It is evident that these judgments of good and bad yield a theory of music, in which, from the most definite and indubitable principles, can be found an explanation of the nature of those things which please as well as those which displease. Therefore, in the present work, I resolve to investigate these principles and to base a theory of music upon them. Although many undertook this task, yet none have advanced beyond a theory of consonances, and, indeed, even this has not been treated so that it might be used in the practice of music. However, even if we do not complete the task, we leave to others to decide whatever may be worthwhile in this book. Meanwhile, the highly tested precepts arising from our theory agree with the music so excellently that we cannot at all doubt the solidity and truth of this theory. In this procedure we have especially adhered to the function of a natural philosopher and inquired into the true reasons for those things which are observed not only to please but also to displease. Then, if theory is found to agree with experience, it seems to us that our prescribed task will have been done well.

In the first place, therefore, it is fitting that the principles of sound be attacked again at the very source. Not only have we set forth these principles more accurately than has been done hitherto, but also we have adapted the main elements for the establishment of the foundations of music. We have clearly shown what kind of vibrations of air particles all sound consists of and how that motion affects the auditory sense, resulting in the comprehension of sound. Thus it was observed that the hearing of a tone is simply the perception of many pulses following each other at equal intervals of time, and the degree of highness or lowness of sounds is determined by the frequency of those pulses, so that the more pulses striking the ear in the same period, the higher the sound is reckoned to be. Then we examined various methods of producing sounds, which we reduced to three kinds, and determined from these methods the speed of the pulses which a given body of sounds transfers into the air. From this we could determine the number of pulses produced in the interval of one second by each of the usual pitches in music. And in this treatise we have presented an entirely new theory of sounds provided by wind instruments, and here agreement with experience is so great that that theory must be acknowledged to be in accordance with the facts. In addition, we carefully investigated the intensity of sounds, and we showed how to produce musical instruments so that all tones, however diverse in ratio of pitch, can still be produced with equal power, from which it is seen that there results no little help in the manufacture of musical instruments.

Music theory rests upon dual foundations, one of which is contained in the exact knowledge of sound, that which properly belongs to natural science and is sufficiently set forth in the first chapter. The other foundation is based on metaphysics, for we need to know how several sounds, simultaneous as well as successive, please or displease the auditory perception. Led by reason as well as experience, we attacked that problem and drew the conclusion that two or more sounds are pleasing when the ration, which exists between the numbers of vibrations produced at the same time, is understood; on the other hand, dissatisfaction is present when either no order is felt or that order which it seems to have is suddenly confused. Then we showed how the order of sounds, which is contained in the ratio of vibrations produced at the same time or in equal periods of time, is distinctly perceived; from this, then, we proceeded to consider the fact that some ratios are perceived more easily than others. Inquiring into the cause of this distinction, we graded this perceptive ability in certain degrees, which are of greatest importance in music and also may be found to be of great value in other arts and sciences of which beauty is a part. Those degrees are arranged in accordance with the ease of perceiving the ratios, and all those ratios which can be perceived with equal facility are related to the same degree. Thus, to the first degree belongs only one ratio, the simplest of all, i.e., equality, which, where it exists, is at once most easily perceived and is created by two equal sounds. After this comes the second degree, to which, in like manner, belongs only one ratio, which is the double ratio; for this is more easily perceived than all others except the ratio of equality, and in music it forms the interval which is called diapason or octave. On the other hand, two ratios, namely the triple and quadruple, were found to belong to the third degree, since these two ratios are perceived with equal facility; and, in this manner, we followed up the remaining degrees in turn, including in each only those ratios perceived with equal facility. We call these _degrees of agreeableness_ because it is understood from them how much agreeableness each consonance has in itself or, what amounts to the same thing, how much facility is required for perceiving it; whence it is understood how much more easily some ratios can be perceived than others, wherever they may appear. Besides, it will be clear that the distinctiveness of these ratios does not lie in the names which the ancient gave to them, and that the Pythagoreans were mistaken in saying that multiple ratios are more easily perceived than superparticular ratios, and superparticular ratios are more easily perceived than superpartients. But the criterion is to be sought from another, far-removed source from which arise a knowledge and judgment of consonances agreeing much more substantially with experience. Upon these two principles, one physical, the other metaphysical, we build the whole theory of music.

As to the plan followed in this treatise, I first divided music into two principal types in which beauty and attractiveness are united. One type rests upon the distinction between low and high sounds; the other depends upon the duration of sounds. But today's music is usually highly seasoned with both types; yet even now examples can be observed in which one type or the other finds favor. In this treatise we decided to deal chiefly with that agreeableness which arises from the discrimination of sounds by the ratio of highness and lowness, since the other type would be less difficult to treat and can be understood from our treatment of the first type. In the discrimination of highness and lowness the proportions use 2, 3, or 5 as factors; in the discrimination of duration, musicians have not reached this point but have drawn all agreeableness of this kind from the numbers 2 and 3 alone. in this durational category, the hearing cannot comprehend such composite ratios as it can be in the category of intervals. In explanation, therefore, of musical composition which pays so much attention to the difference between high and low sounds, we began by treating of the consonances or of several tones occurring at the same time. We listed and properly arranged all consonances which can occur in music, from which it can be decided forthwith how much more easily some consonances can be perceived than others. Then we progressed to a succession of two consonances and showed how they ought to be connected so that the succession itself might be rendered pleasing to the hearing. Then we extended the same plan to a series of several consonances and in the same way to any musical works whatever, since the duration of sounds is not considered. Moreover, we referred the judgment of these separate matters to numerical exponents in which may be encompassed all the essence and nature of single consonances as well as of two or more in succession. From this arose first the exponents of simple consonances, then the exponents of two consonances in succession, and then the exponents of a series of several consonances following each other, and by these three categories, universal music, considered in general, is encompassed. Then we were drawn to various kinds of musical composition, and first the principle of musical genera presented itself, in which a musical genus is defined as a combination of various tones suitable for producing harmony. In like manner, we reduced the treatment of this matter to a consideration of exponents. And so we enumerated all musical genera from the simplest up to the most complicated, whatever the ear can tolerate to this point; and in this enumeration we looked into the genera used in the most ancient as well as more recent times, including the simplest genus of Mercury, the diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic genera of the ancients. The first two of these were especially in accord with those facts supplied by harmony, but of the others, namely, the chromatic and enharmonic, only a slight correlation is to be observed. Since the ancients arrived at these classifications partly by hearing alone and partly by confused calculation, it is no wonder if they found so little semblance of true harmony; yet today the faults of these particular genera of theirs are quite evident. They busied themselves with the diatonic genus for a long time before it was declared suited to true harmony, since it is said not to have been accepted until Ptolemy. Our eighteenth genus remarkably with that which is now most widely used and is usually called the diatonic-chromatic genus, for it contains in one octave twelve tones differing from one another by nearly equal intervals, namely, by semitones and limmata, either major or minor. Yet, however much this genus has been admitted into practice in times past, musicians have still constantly introduced changes by which it has been made more pleasing to the hearing, and these changes worked so well that the arrangement of sounds, which is now so highly approved by musicians, may differ from true harmony only in the tone designed as B-flat, and such an agreement would scarcely be expected from the hearing alone.

We have examined in some detail this diatonic-chromatic genus which is most perfectly in accord with the true principles of harmony, and we set forth how it may be applied to various methods of composition; but we also presented several well-arranged genera so that it may be clear that music is capable of even further expansion. Then, having reverted to the diatonic-chromatic genus, we enumerated all consonances which can be found in this genus, and we showed how each should be produced with the most pleasing results. Finally, we explored the principle of musical modes more carefully than had been done before, and we subdivided the individual modes into their own species and systems. By these procedures no little light is shed upon the composition of music. We set forth all these matters as basic and fundamental, upon which a complete theory of music may be erected, and we commit to the expert musicians the further study and adaptation to practice, little doubting that from these principles, music theory as well as music practice can be brought at length to the highest peak of perfection.

CHAPTER I

ON SOUND AND HEARING

1. Since it was proposed that we treat music like a philosophic discipline, in which nothing can be presented unless its conception and truth can be explained by precedent knowledge, we decided to present, before everything else, those principles of sounds and hearing which constitute the material upon which music depends; and this encompasses the final goal of music, i.e., delight of the ears, for these principles show how to produce tones and to join them together skillfully so that pleasing harmony affects the sense of hearing with delight. Thus, our purpose requires a discussion of the nature, production, and varieties of sounds; and a sufficient knowledge of physics and mathematics is desirable. Then, certainly, if along with these subjects the special organs of hearing be considered, we will understand how we hear and comprehend sound. Moreover, this discussion will show how useful those subjects may be in establishing and demonstrating the foundations of music, since the agreeableness of sounds depends on, and should be explained by, the matter of comprehension.

2.All those who have written at least with integrity on this matter state that sound exists in the air, which is the transporting medium by which it may be spread in any direction from its source. Indeed, it could not be otherwise, since nothing but air surrounds our ears and can bring about changes in them. Although it may be suggested that the process of hearing be considered in the same manner as those of taste and sight which are stimulated, not by air, but by actual emissions from the object itself, yet, if a sound-making instrument be placed in a vacuum produced by a pneumatic pump, and if there is no contact with the outside air, it may be shown that no sound will be heard, no matter how near one may approach. Yet, as soon as air is permitted to enter, sound is again heard. From this it follows that air and its change which the sound-producing instrument causes, constitute the basic material of sound.

3. In order that it may be clear as to just what is that change of modification of air stimulating the sense of hearing, it will be appropriate to consider a particular case in which a sound is produced and to investigate the resulting effect in the air. For this purpose, let us consider a stretched string which produces sound when plucked. But this plucking produces in the string nothing but a vibratory motion by which it moves most rapidly to and fro between its ends, now on one side, now on the other side of its position of the rest. In the case of thicker strings, this motion can easily be seen by the eyes; with thinner strings, even if it cannot be discerned, it still cannot be doubted to exist. Besides, if one touches a ringing bell, he will actually feel the vibration. Finally, it is shown from the laws of mechanics that both the string and the bell have vibrating motion when struck; and for this reason, knowledge of the basic nature of sound should sought only in the vibrating motion.

4. Therefore, since the change of the air produced by the vibrating body naturally affects the sense of hearing, we should investigate how the air is affected by the vibrating body. We see that the pulsing motion consists in the repetition of successive vibrations. The air surrounding the vibrating body is set in motion by these individual vibrations and retains similar vibrations which it transfers in like manner to more distant air particles. In this way such pulses and vibrations are sent out into all the surrounding air, and the original vibrations are spread over a considerable area. From this observed that the individual particles of air must move in a vibratory motion similar to that of the body itself, with the difference that the pulses become smaller and weaker as they spread further from the source, until, at least, nothing more can be heard at a great distance.

5. From these things it is understood that only pulses are transferred through the air to the ears by the sounding body; hence, it must be true that the sensation of sound is brought about by these very pulses which are produced in the air and fall on the ear. The sensation of hearing is explained in this way: There exists in the internal cavity of the ear a stretched membrane, called tympanum from its resemblances to a drum. This membrane receives the pulses from the air and retransmits them to the auditory nerves; and thus it happens that there is the sensation of sound while these nerves are affected. Therefore, sound is nothing but the perception of successive pulses which occur in the air particles situated around the ear, and any object capable of producing such pulses is suitable for producing sound.

6. The propagation of sound through the air is not instantaneous, but a certain period of time is required for it to travel a given distance. The rate of speed at which it travels is uniform and depends neither upon the strength of the sound nor upon its quality. From experiments, theoretical computation, and the nature of vibrations, it has been established that all sound moves a distance of 1100 Rhenish feet<fn>One Rhenish foot equals about 12.356 inches.</fn> in one second, 2200 feet in two seconds, 330 feet in three seconds, and so on. We observe this slowness of sounds daily. For example, if we stand at some distance from a gun when it is fired, we hear its report after we see its flash; and if we stand near the gun, we seem to hear the noise and see the flash simultaneously. Similarly, we do not hear thunder until after the lightning, and, in some places favorable for echo, a shout is followed by several repetitions.

7. Therefore, whatever can thus set in motion these smallest particles of air so that they receive a vibratory motion, can also produce sound. In addition to the use of solid objects for this purpose, there are two other methods of producing sound. Furthermore, from the three methods arise three classifications of sounds, if one considers the causes. The first classification consists of those which originate in a vibrating body, and to this group belong the sounds of bells and strings. Another classification comprises of those which come from highly compressed air suddenly regaining its original pressure. This includes such sounds as those made by muskets, cannons, thunder, and rods snapped through the air. To the third classification we assign the sounds of those instruments which are blown, such as pipes, flutes, etc.; and the causes of those sounds will subsequently be shown not to depend on the vibratory motion of the material of which the instruments consist.

8. From the first classification we are to consider chiefly the stretched strings, made either of metal or of the intestines of animals, which are set in motion for producing sound either by striking or rubbing. They are plucked and struck in the cases of harpsichords, harps, and other instruments of this kind; they are rubbed in the cases of the panduras and violins, with the aid of stretched horsehairs, to which a roughness is added with rosin. In any case, the strings receive a vibratory motion, for they are forced from a natural position of rest and tend to return to it. In fact, rushing toward this position an accelerated motion, they acquire such a great speed upon reaching it that they cannot suddenly decelerate, and therefore they cannot immediately regain it. For this reason, the string must go beyond its initial position and return to it in a similar manner; and these oscillations will persist until they completely die away because of resistance.

9. By calculation based on the laws of motion, it is possible to determine how many such oscillations a vibrating string or body produces in a given period, if one takes into consideration the length, weight, and tension of the string. But in our calculation we should not use the length and weight of the whole string, but only of that part which actually vibrates and produces sound, and which is usually separated from the whole string by two fulcrums. These fulcrums permit the desired portion of the string to vibrate. In order to determine the tension, it is most expedient to fix one end of the string and to attach to the other end a weight which sustains the tension. With this done, if the length of the sounding string be represented by _a_ in thousandths of a foot and if the ratio of the suspended weight to the weight of the string be _n_:1, the number of oscillations which this string completes in a second may be represented thus:

[equation]

where 355:113 denotes the ratio<fn>This approximation for _pi_ was given by the Chinese Tsu Ch'ung-chih in the Fifth Century. The symbol _pi_ in its present sense has been in use since Euler adopted it in 1737.</fn> of the circumference of a circle to the diameter and 3166 thousandths of a Rhenish foot is the length of a pendulum which makes one oscillation a second.

10. As long as they last, these oscillations are isochronal. That is, each oscillation takes the same length of time for completion, and the size of the oscillations does not disturb this pattern, unless, perhaps, when the string is struck too powerfully, the vibrations are faster at the very beginning. The same ratio applies to pendulums, whose oscillations, if they are not too large, are equal in time. To illustrate the formula given in the preceding paragraph, I took a string 1510 thousandths of a Rhenish foot in length and 6 1/5 grains in weight; I stretched it by a weight of 6 pounds<fn>The old German _pfund_ varied from 1.01 to 1.23 U. S. pounds.</fn> or 46080 grains. Using the given formula, we have 
a = 1510
and
n=46080:6 1/5 = 7432
Therefore, the number of vibrations produced in a second will be
(355/113)sqrt(3166.7432/1510) = 392
I observed that this tone corresponds with the key designated as _a_ on an instrument.

11. If we consider several stretched strings, the ratios among their vibrations are easily determined. In the case of any two strings, for instance, this ratio may be expressed as
sqrt(n_1/a_1) / sqrt(n_2/a_2)
where a_1 represents the vibrating length of the first string, a_2, the vibrating length of the second string, and so on. If the strings have the same length, the ratio will be sqrt(n_1/n_2). If the strings are equal in weight and length, the ratio will be as the square roots of the weights used for the stretching. And if the stretching weights are equal and the strings differ in length, the ratio will be a_2/a_1; that is, the number of vibrations produced in any given period would vary as the reciprocal ratio of the strings' lengths, since the weights are proportional to the lengths. 

12. Differentiation of tones as to highness and lowness depends on the slowness or rapidity of the vibrations, and we say that the lower a sound is, the fewer vibrations strike the ear in a certain period, and the higher it is, the more such vibrations are felt in the same period. The truth of this is established from experience itself; for if various weights are attached successively to the same string, we note that the tones are higher if the weights are larger and lower if they are smaller. From our foregoing discussion it is apparent that the heavier weights produce the more rapid vibrations. For this reason, when the difference of highness and lowness of tones is particularly desired, we will measure the tones by the number of vibrations produced in a certain period or we will consider the tones as quantities of which the size is fixed by the number of vibrations occurring in a prescribed time.

13. Just as we can react with our senses to things neither to small nor too larger, even in sounds some moderation is required. All perceptible sounds will lie within certain limits, and the ear will no longer respond to those sounds which exceed the limits by going either too high or too low. To a certain extent, those limits can be determined. The pitches _a_, C, and c''' have 392, 118, and 1888 vibrations per second respectively. About to octaves lower than C and higher than c''', points where the sounds can scarcely be heard, we reach the extremes of perceptible sound and express them by the numbers 30 and 7520; this range is sufficiently wide and admits a great diversity of pitches, inasmuch as it comprises about eight octaves.

14. After the differentiation of highness and lowness in tones, we should consider their variations in intensity. The intensity of a tone varies according of the position of the hearer; for the further he is from the vibrating string, the weaker the tone seems to him, since the propagation through the air of vibrations as well as light constantly becomes weaker. The reason for this diminution is that sound spreads into more space at greater distances from its source; at twice the distance it must be perceptible in four times the area. Hence, if the aggregate of all the vibrations is in proportion, it follows that the sound has one-fourth the strength at twice the distance. Similarly, at three times the distance, the sound will be one-ninth as strong, and so on, so that the intensity of sound varies inversely as the square of the distance.

15. These statements hold true if the sound spreads out equally in all directions. But if there should be circumstances such that the sound travels more readily in one area than another, it is heard more loudly there than it would be according to the rule. For example, if someone shouts through one end of a tube, he who puts his ear to the other end will hear the sound almost as well as if he had received it from the very mouth of the shouter. Similar is the case of the speaking trumpets, through which the sound is projected most powerfully into that area toward which the instrument is directed. Sounds as well as rays of light are reflected by south, hard surface, and thus it is possible to change the direction of sound rays, which are so named from the similarity to light rays; in this way, it can happen that several rays are brought together at the same place.

16. As the vibrating string transmits pulses through the air by its oscillations, it is inevitable that its motion will constantly diminish and the sound will become weaker. This is certainly an observable phenomenon in the case of the vibrating string, for initially the sound is loudest, then becomes gradually fainter, until finally it stops completely. However, as long as the vibrations last, they remain isochronal and the tone retains its particular pitch. At the very beginning, this intensity in a given string depends on the force used to set it in motion, so that the greater the force, the louder the sound. But if the string is struck to vigorously and is forced too far from tis natural position, a higher sound is produced at the very beginning; and this irregularity of vibrations causes the sound to be less pleasing and less distinct. 

17. This is particularly the case if the string is too loose or has insufficient tension, for then there are greater irregularities in oscillation, and the sound which is produced is neither consistent nor pleasing. For this reason, in order that agreeable and consistent tones may be produced, it is necessary that the suspended weights stretch the strings as far as possible without breaking them. The strengths of the strings made of the same material are proportional to their thicknesses, and hence the weights capable of stretching the strings to their breaking points are proportional to the thicknesses; but the thicknesses of strings are proportional to their weights divided by their lengths, and, therefore, the stretching weights must be directly proportional to the weights of the strings and inversely proportional to the length. That is, if the weight of the string is called _q_, the length _a_, and the stretching weight _p_, then _p_ should vary as _q/a_, or _ap/q_ should be a constant.

18. In the production of tones of equal intensity, we should consider the force setting the string in motion, in addition to the length of the string and the stretching weight. Even the place where the string is struck or plucked should be considered, but if we assume all strings to be struck in the middle or in any place similar on all, this factor does not enter into the computation. After this follows the fact that the stronger the striking force is, the the more intense the sound. Musical instruments are usually made so that all strings are struck with equal force, and hence we may consider this force always to be essentially the same. Then, too, the intensity of a sound depends upon the velocity with which the air particles set in motion by the vibrating string strike the ear, and this must be determined from the highest velocity of the string. This velocity is proportional to the square root of the weight stretching the string divided by the length of the string. Thus, if sounds are to be equal in intensity, it is necessary that the ratio of the stretching weight to the length in each case remains the same. 

19. Therefore, to return to our quantities _a_, _p_, and _q_, the ratio _p/a_ should always be the same. It has already been ascertained that _ap/q_ should be a constant. Hence it follows that the quotient of these fractions,
_ap/q_ ÷ _p/a_ = _a²/q_
must also be a constant, or the ratio of _q/a_ to _a_ must the same in all strings. But _q/a_ is proportional to the thickness of the string, and thus the thickness is proportional to the length. Similarly, the stretching weight itself must be proportional to the length. In any case, the pitch is proportional to sqrt(p/aq), and if we substitute the proportionals _a_ and _a²_ for _p_ and _q_, the pitch will vary inversely as the length of the string. Thus the stretching weight, length, and weight of the string must each be inversely proportional to the pitch or to the number of vibrations produced in a given time. This rule will be quite useful in the manufacture of musical instruments.

20. As we have said, if the string does not have sufficient tension, the sound will be less pleasing because the irregularities of vibrations will be too great and will simply stir the air rather than effect regular oscillations. For unless the air is set in motion with almost instantaneous high velocity, it does not easily acquire the vibratory motion required for sound; but the more tension a string has, the greater its rate of vibrations immediately after it has been struck. In the case of too great initial amplitude, the larger vibrations are not isochronal to the smaller, whence the sound gradually becomes lower and does not remain the same. Then it easily happens that the whole string string does not complete all vibrations at the same time, but one part of it may reach its maximum speed or state of rest more rapidly or more slowly than another part, so that the sound is uneven and harsh.

21. Besides these differences of sounds in music, the duration of sounds should be considered. With many instruments, as in the case of those in which are set in motion by striking or plucking, the tones cannot be prolonged at will, for their tones gradually become weaker and soon die out completely. For this reason, not as much can be done about duration of sounds as in the case of those instruments capable of sustaining tones with the same intensity as long as desired. To this category belong those whose strings are kept in motion by a plectrum, the flutes, and other instruments, such as the pipe organ; and, in contrast to the others, these instruments have the prerogative of being able to produce and express all agreeableness which exists in the durational aspects of sound. The duration of a sound is measured by the time elapsing between its beginning and end.

22. Thus far we have considered only the tones of strings from the first classification of sounds, i.e., those which have their origin in a vibrating body; and we have also set forth the chief differences of sounds. Now, therefore, before proceeding classifications, we should consider the other instruments which produce sounds of the first classification. Here belongs the bell, which vibrates as a whole to produce sound. Even when the shape and weight of a bell are known, it is indeed most difficult to determine what kind of sound it will produce; yet, if bells are similar in shape and made of the same material, it is simple to determine that the pitches vary inversely as the cube roots of the weights, so that a bell eight times lighter than another produces a sound with twice as many vibrations in the same time, and a bell twenty-seven times lighter produces three times as many.

23. There are also musical instruments with elastic rods made either of metal by which the sounds of bells are imitated, or of hardwood. About these, if their shape is either prismatic or cylindrical, it is easier to come to definite conclusions, for the pitches are seen to depend greatly on the length, since any extension of length would be expected to change the number of vibrations. The pitches or numbers of vibrations produced in the same time will be inversely proportional to the squares of the lengths of rods made of the same material. Consider prisms of similar size and shape but made of different materials. If one undertakes to determine theoretically the pitch of each prism, he must take into consideration not only the ratios of the specific gravities but also the ratios of the cohesion and elasticity of the materials.

24. Under the second classification of sounds I included those which arise either from abrupt release of stream of highly compressed air or from a strong percussion of air. To be sure, these methods are similar. Because of the highly rapid vibration, the air cannot give way, and thus it follows that the portion of the air receiving the percussion is compressed, but it expands again when the disturbing force is gone. But this compressed air, suddenly expanding, requires more than its normal space and then has to recompress into less than its normal space. Therefore, by these alternating contractions and expansions, pulses are effected in the surrounding air, just as in the case of a vibrating body, and sound is produced in the ear. Although air in oscillation in this manner will reach in all directions in its natural state, yet this condition will persist only until all vibratory motion is lost. It is well known from mechanics that a rapidly moving body, arriving at its position of rest, cannot remain there but must go beyond it because of the momentum. It is just as difficult for a moving body to stop suddenly as it is for a body at rest to be moved; and just as much energy is required for stopping the motion of a body as is required for producing the motion. For this reason, we see that when the oscillating pendulum reaches its vertical position and the vibrating string attains its natural position, neither can come to rest. Sounds produced in the manner described can last only for a short time, unless there exists echo or some similar resonating condition which may repeat or prolong them; for, by spreading the motion into such scattered places, the air must forthwith lose its special motion.

26. Therefore all conditions which can make the air either lose or gain compression so that it can suddenly expand or contract, are suitable for the production of sound. Hence, all bodies moving rapidly through the air should produce sounds, for air, because of its inertia, is not able to give way freely to these bodies and thus is compressed by them. The rapid expansion of the air causes a vibratory motion in its smallest particles. Thus originate the sounds of vibrating rods and of all bodies moving rapidly through the air. Even the hissing sounds of winds and blowing have the same cause, for the anterior air is forced and compressed by the following posterior air, which fills the role of a solid object.

27. Of sounds which are produced by the sudden release of highly compressed air, undoubtedly the most powerful at a distance are those made by explosions of gunpowder and thunder. Various experiments have shown that air in an explosion of gunpowder is highly compressed, and, as it expands, it finds an outlet from which powerful sounds emerge. It seems highly probably that a great many nitrous and sulphurous particles mix to form vapour clouds and that these particles, combined and exploded, are capable of producing great noise.<fn>This explanation of thunder preceded the studies of atmospheric electric phenomena by Benjamin Franklin, who flew his famous kite in the thunderstorm in 1752.</fn> If we compare such sounds one after another, the task of distinguishing the differences in pitch is an almost impossible one. Hence, all sounds of this kind are not admitted to music, and for this reason we will go no further with this classification in investigating the vibrations of the smallest air particles.

28. The sounds of wind instruments belong to the third of the classifications mentioned previously. In this case, more is concealed, and the facts behind this classification have always been investigated with less assiduity. Consider those people who decide to deal with the vibratory motion of the tube itself and in this way include it in that classification which list as the first. I fail to see how they can explain the known properties of pipes. For it has been observed that cylindrical pipes of equal length produce the same pitch, however much these pipes may differ among themselves in width, thickness, or materials of which they are made. How, then, is it possible for such diverse tubes to vibrate similarly? The very diversity of materials seems sufficient to reject the judgment of those who think that only the inner surface vibrates. We conclude that the pitch of a sound of this classification depends only on the pipe length.

29. Although it would suffice for our purposes simple to examine the properties of pipes, yet, since discovery of cause always leads to the most perfect knowledge of any matter, I carefully and diligently investigated the true cause of these sounds. Having considered the structure of pipes, I began my reason in the following manner: Everyone knows that a flute pipe is a tube joined at one end by a foot, which receives air from the mouth or wind chest and conducts it into the end of the pipe through a flue. It is necessary, moreover, that the air expelled from the flue not rush into the hollow of the tube, but it must graze the internal surface with nearly instantaneous maximum velocity. For this reason, craftsmen cut out a part of the tube next to the flue so that there is a break between the tube and the foot, and they sharpen the edge above the flue so that the air rushing onto the sharp edge is divided and a thiner stream of air goes into the tube.

30. While experience shows what shape the foot must take, it is evident that the foot can be imitated by the human mouth itself. For if we blow with the mouth into a tube without a foot, so that the air is steadily introduced onto the inner surface, hen the sound is produced just as if the tube were provided with a foot. And thus we have an explanation for the different flutes without feet, such as the transverse flutes and others similar which are blown in the manner just described. In order that the ingress of air into the tube may produce sound, it is first required that the inner surface of the tube be smooth, so that the motion of air will not be obstructed suddenly. Secondly, it is required that the side of the tube be firm and unyielding to the incoming stream of air. Thirdly, it follows that the tube must be airtight.

31. These and other matter which must be taken into account in the construction of flue pipes will be understood better if we explain just how sounds are formed in pipes. It has already been shown that a vibratory motion is produced neither in the whole tube nor on the interior surface alone. For air entering a tube necessarily compresses the length of that column of air already in the tube; then the column expands and is compressed again, and in this manner, as long as the wind pressure continues, the oscillations are produced which, in turn, produce sound. Now we may see to what degree this sound, following laws of mechanics, is proportional in pitch to the length of the tube, and hence we may observe how well this explanation agrees with the phenomena.

32. The air contained in a tube is a body which produces oscillations and transfers them to the surrounding air, and its quantity is known from the length and width (radius) of the tube. As we have seen, the power producing the oscillatory motion is air introduced under pressure along the inner surface. But the air in the tube exerts a certain force to restore itself to its natural state. This force, which causes a certain number of oscillations to be produced in a given time, consists of the weight of the atmosphere or the elasticity of the air which is equal to the atmospheric pressure. This power can be estimated from its effect, which is clearly shown by a Torricelli tube<fn>The barometer was invented by Evangelista Torricelli in 1643</fn> in which the column of mercury is held suspended at a height of from 22 to 24 digits.<fn>The digit is the Rhenish inch and equals .75 inches (U. S.)</fn>

33. The vibratory process of this column of air in the tube is quite similar to that by which the stretched string produces vibrations. For the string may be compared with the air contained in the tube of a flue pipe. In this case, the weight of the atmosphere takes the place of the weight stretching the string. On the one hand, the string is stretched by a suspended weight; on the other hand, the air is compressed by atmospheric pressure. These weights may seem to be completely different, yet, if we consider the effect in each case, they are clearly equivalent. For each helps in the production of oscillations by giving to an adjacent body of the power of regaining its natural position. Whether by compression of the air of a tube or by stretching of a string, the same effect is produced.

34. Therefore, since air in the tube of a pipe vibrates like a stretched string, we will also be able to determine the number of oscillations produced in a given time and thus to determine the pitch itself from our work with vibrating strings. Let the length of the pipe be _a_, expressed in thousandths of a Rhenish foot, and take _b²_ as the base area, _m:n_ as the ratio of the specific gravity of the air to that of mercury, and _k_ as the height of the mercury in a barometer. Therefore, we will have the equivalent of a string of length _a_ and weight _mab²_, which is stretched by a weight equal to the atmospheric pressure and equivalent to a cylinder of mercury whose base is b², i.e., the base area of the tube, and whose height is _k_.  Hence the stretching weight can be considered as _nkb²_. By making the appropriate substitutions in the formula for strings, we find that the number of oscillations produced in a second is
[eqn]
and this quantity measures the pitch.

35. Because the ratio m:n almost always remains the same and _k_ is affected very little by changes in the weather, the pitches of pipes having either cylindrical or prismatic tubes will be inversely proportional to the lengths of the tubes, so that the shorter the tubes are, the higher the sounds they produce, and the longer they are, the lower the sounds. This clearly agrees with experience, and anyone who considers the previously mentioned properties of pipes may now easily understand that the pitch depends neither upon the width of the pipe nor on the material from which the tube is made, but on the length alone. Wherefore, I believe that there can be no possible doubt that this explanation of the sounds produced by pipes is authentic and based on the natural properties of matter.

36. This explanation will be even more strongly confirmed if we not only examine the reason for these sounds but if we also will investigate their relationship to the pitch of a given strong stretched by a given weight. For if experiment shows that a pipe is consonant with a given string specified theoretically, then this will be a most powerful support of our argument. In the warmest weather the ratio n:m has a maximum value of about 12,000 but runs about 10,000 in the coldest times. Similarly, if the mercury in a barometer climbs to the maximum height, then _k_=2460; and, similarly, _k_ will have a minimum value of about 2260. Therefore, if the thermometer and the barometer give their highest readings, the pitch of a flue pipe may be expressed as _960426/a_, and if the readings are the lowest, the pitch will be _840348/a_.

37. We may use the average of these figures, _900387/a_, as the number of vibrations per second produced by a pipe of a length _a_ in ordinary weather. Therefore, that pipe which produces 100 vibrations per second has a length of about 9 Rhenish feet, and that pipe which produces 118 vibrations corresponding in pitch to the string producing C, should have a length of a little more 7 1/2 Rhenish feet. This corresponds quite closely to experience, for generally a pipe 8 feet in length is assumed to produce C. The difference of half a foot should be completely disregarded, since the same pipe, in varying weather, may vary in pitch with a ratio of 840348:96042 or 8:9 between the lowest and highest pitches, and this variation would exceed that caused by the difference of half a foot.

38. This very diversity of pitches from the same pipe in various temperatures further substantiates the truth of our explanation. When musicians use stringed instruments at the same time as wind instruments, they constantly find the latter to be extremely changeable, and the strings, in order that they may be in tune with the winds, have to be tightened, then loosened. It was also noted that the difference between the highest and lowest sounds of the same pipe is about a whole tone, which is the interval between sounds having a ratio of 8:9. Moreover, it was observed that pipes are pitched higher when the weather is clearest and the temperature is highest. On the other hand, when the weather is stormiest and coldest, the pipes are pitched lower. From these facts, it is clear why a wind instrument has a lower pitch initially and a higher pitch after it has been blown vigorously, for the breathing and motion make the air in the tube warmer, and, consequently, a higher sound is produced.

39. The intensity of sounds produced by a pipe depends not only on the wind pressure but also on the ratio of its width to its length. If we consider thickness instead of width, such a ratio has its counterpart in the case of a string. Therefore, just as every string is not suitable for producing all sounds, but a particular thickness is required for a given pitch, it is also true that a pipe of a given length cannot be made wide or narrow at will; but there are limits beyond which the pipe may produce no sound at all. In order that several pipes may produce similar sounds of equal intensity, it is necessary that the width of each pipe or the base of the tube, just as the thickness of the string, be proportional to the length. Thus, from the requirements of a string, it follows that atmospheric pressure, which is proportional to the width of the tube, evidently has the same ratio to the length of the pipe.

40. Indeed, the wind pressure cannot be increased or decreased at will. For if the pressure is insufficient, no sound at all is produced, but the pressure can be so great that a pipe will produce a sound an octave than its normal sound. A further increase in pressure will produce the twelfth, then the fifteenth, etc. In order that we may discover the reason for this rise in pitch, it will be beneficial to consider the intensity of  the sound as proportional to the wind pressure; and, therefore, as long as the pitch remains the same, it is understood that the greater the pressure, the wider--but not the more frequent--must be the oscillations of the air in the tube. but the amplitude of the oscillations is so limited by diameter or width of the tube, that it cannot exceed a fixed limit; therefore, if the wind pressure is so great that the amplitude would exceed this limit, the pipe will not produce its normal pitch.<fn>Actually, the column of air tends to vibrate at the frequency of its partial nearest excitation frequency, which is that of the edge tone for the flue pipes and of the reed for reed-pipes. In the case of the brass-wind instruments, the player's lips are analogous to the reeds.</fn>

41. Moreover, in the case of a string, to which a pipe is to be considered similar, it is in agreement with theory as well as experience that each half of a stretched string can produce its oscillations separately so that the string produces, not its usual sound, but an octave higher; but it cannot do this if the parts are unequal . Similarly, a string divided--in imagination, at least--into three equal parts can oscillate just as if the parts were separated by bridges, so that each part vibrates separately and produces a higher sound, namely, the twelfth. In like manner, higher sounds are produced by four or more equal parts of the string. (In _Memoirs de l'academie royale des scinences_, 1701, J. Sauveur showed how these things can be worked out and confirmed by experiments.)

42. Applying these ideas to the pipe, we understand that each half of the pipe can vibrate separately and thus produce a sound an octave higher. In this case, since the vibrations are doubled in frequency, the greater will be the wind pressure. If this pressure is increased beyond the fixed limit,it follows that the oscillations will conform to the conditions and a sound an octave higher than normal will be produced. Here, too, exists a limit which the pressure must not exceed; but, if it does, then the column of air in the tube begins to oscillate in three separate parts at the same time, and a higher sound, the twelfth, is produced. If the pressure is increased still further, then the column oscillates in four parts, producing a sound two octaves higher, and so on.

43. Also depending on these phenomena, but differing in other respects from the flue pipes, are the trumpets and trombones, which have the ability to change their pitch by wind pressure alone. These instruments cannot produce all pitches, but only those which can be expressed by the integer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. Thus they can produce no sound in their lowest octave between 1 and 2; only one sound, 3, which is fifth to 2, in the next octave between 2 and 4; three sounds, 5, 6, and 7, in the third octave between 4 and 8; and seven sounds in the fourth octave. It is evident that the structure of such instruments is such that any sound has exceedingly narrow pressure limits, and, therefore, by very little intensification or relaxation of wind pressure, the sound is made higher or lower.

44. The statements which have been made thus far about pipes pertain mostly to those whose tubes are either prismatic or cylindrical. However, if the pipes are conical or of some other shape, it is more difficult to determine what kinds of sounds they will produce. Yet, when such questions arise, one can always look to the strings for answers; for in the case of any proposed shape of a pipe, one ought to consider a string counterpart and to investigate the sound which is produced. From this, we consider the string itself as the air and the stretching weight as the atmospheric pressure, we will have the pitch produced by the given pipe, and if this problem is solved generally for any shape of a pipe, the well known property of prismatic pipes to produce a sound an octave lower when closed at the top will also be clear.

45. The trumpets and trombones, which evidently have an affinity with the pipes,<fn>The basic principle of tone production is the same in each case.</fn> do not produce sound by wind pressure alone but require, in addition to the blowing, some sound from the player's mouth; and these instruments considerably strengthen this sound in the same manner in which the speaking trumpet so greatly magnifies the human voice. Such instruments are understood better if we consider the imitative pipes of the pneumatic organ. These require wind pressure only, but inserted in the foot are flexible plates which are made to vibrate by the incoming air and which also produce a weak sound. But as this sound proceeds through the adjoining tube, it acquires so much power from the tube that it imitates brilliantly the sounds of trumpet of trombones.


CHAPTER II

ON AGREEABLENESS AND THE PRINCIPLES OF HARMONY

1. Since I have decided to investigate in this chapter how it happens that some things affecting our sense please us and others displease, I do not believe it at all necessary to point out that there is a _system_ or _order_ here and that our minds are not pleased purely by chance. Today it is generally accepted as an axiom that nothing happens in the word without a rational basis, and it should not be doubted that there exists some explanation of those things which please. If this is conceded, we must reject the opinion of those who suppose that music depends solely upon the judgment of men, that our music pleases us by custom alone, and that barbarian music displeases because we are unaccustomed to it.

2. I do not deny--and indeed I shall prove--that by exercise and repeated hearing it can happen that some harmony, initially displeasing, begins to please us, and conversely. Yet this principle of rational basis is not subverted, for the explanation of pleasure or displeasure should be sought not only in the object itself but in the senses by which the image of the object is represented to the mind; and also attention should be given to the powerful judgment which the mind itself forms concerning the object under consideration. Since these things can happen in various ways with different men and even with the same man at various times, it is no wonder that the same object can please some and displease others.

3. But now I see what kind of argument all this may bring against us and our purpose. No doubt someone will say that the principles and rules of harmony cannot be systematized and that, for this reason, our labor, as well as that of all who have tried to codify musical laws, is worthless and futile. If some things please some people and other things please others, and these things which please are diverse and antipodal, how can rules of conjoining sounds be taught so that they will represent agreeable harmony to the hearing? Rules, if found, will be too universal to have any real use or will be neither stable nor uniform, bu will have to be accommodated to the hearers. This not only would require unlimited diligence but also would take aways certitude from music.

4. The composer should conduct himself like the architect, who disregards the bad judgment of many concerning buildings and constructs edifices according to the definite laws based on nature itself. Even if these structures do not please those who are ignorant of these matters, he is content if they are approved by the informed. For in music as in architecture the tastes of different people are so diverse that that which pleases some is rejected by others. For this reason, in music as well as in all other matters, it is most important to follow those whose taste is perfect and whose judgment of things perceived by the senses is faultless. In this category are those to whom nature has given an acute and refined sense of hearing, and these individuals, precisely comprehending those things represented aurally, produce a consensus of sound judgment. 

5. Since every sound, as shown in the preceding chapter, is nothing but a series of pulses produced in the air, we will perceive sound distinctly if we sense all the pulses in the ear, comprehend their order, and perceive the relative strength of each when the pulses are not equal in power. Thus, for the judgment of matters musical, the required auditors are those endowed with both an acute sense of hearing and precise comprehension, and they also possess such a degree of intellect as to enable them to perceive the order in which the pulses of the air particles strike the ear and from this to pass judgment. As we will show later, this is necessary for recognizing whether agreeableness actually exists in a given piece of music and what degree of agreeableness it has.

6. Therefore, before everything else, we will apply ourselves, in whatever is under discussion, to the task of defining what it is, why it pleases or displeases us, and what it must possess in order for it to please us. From this, as may have been evident, the true principles and rules for composing harmonious music can be derived, since the position of that which pleases or displeases will have been established. From this source should be derived not only those things pertaining to music but also all other matters which have the same purpose: to please. This extends so widely that, by the principles which we are considering, almost anything can be assigned some degree of agreeableness. 

7. Consulting metaphysicians, to whom this investigation should be of particular interest, we find that everything please us in which we perceive perfection to exist, and so we are pleased more when we observe more perfection. On the other hand, we are displeased by those things in which we perceive a lack of perfection or much imperfection. It is true that pleasure is given by the perception of perfection, and all minds, in order to enjoy discovering perfection, tend to reject those things in which they find a lack of perfection or the presence of imperfection. This will be clear to anyone who considers carefully those things which please him, for he will perceive that that which pleases is a kind of perfection and that that which displeases lack perfection.

8. We understand that perfection exists in something if we observe that it is so constituted that all of its elements combine for fulfilling the intended purpose, but, if there are elements not pertaining to the purpose of standing in its way, we sense a lack of perfection. In the first case, the thing pleases us; in the other case, it displeases us. For example, consider a clock, whose purpose is to show the parts and divisions of time: it pleases us most if we know that all of its parts are made and put together so that all unite to indicate the exact time.

9. From this it follows that in whatever thing perfection exists there should also be order. Since order is an arrangement of parts made according to a definite rule, it is possible to determine why something is located in one place rather than another, and, in a thing having perfection, all parts should be so ordered that they are suitable for fulfilling a purpose. This purpose is a rule according to which the parts are arranged and given their particular position. In turn, therefore, it is understood that where there is order, there is also perfection, and a rule or law of order corresponds to the purpose of obtaining perfection. Thus, if we perceive order, we are pleased, but a lack of order displeases us.

10. We can perceive order in two ways. In the first case, the law or rule is known to us, and we apply it to the given thing. IN the second case, we do not know in advance the law which produced the structure, and we seek this law from the arrangement of the elements. The example of the clock given above belongs to the first case, for the purpose or the law of arrangement of its parts is known to the be indication of time. We should examine the clock to see if its construction is such that it can fulfill this purpose. But, if I examine some series such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 13, 21, ..., without knowing the law by which the progression is formed, I discover, by comparing the numbers a few time, that any of them is the sum of the two immediately preceding it, and I confirm that this is their law of order.<fn>This series is called a Fibonacci sequence, named for Leonardo Fibonacci, the greatest mathematician of the thirteenth century. Joseph Schillinger, the twentieth composer and theorist, has given considerable attention to this series. He calls it a "summation series," making it a basis for variation and composition. See Schillinger, Joseph, _The Mathematical Basis of the Arts_, pp. 32-33, 89, 685.</fn>

11. The second way of perceiving order is particularly pertinent to music, for when we hear music, we perceive the order which is possessed by both the simultaneous and the successive sounds. Hence, the musical harmony will please if we perceive the order of its constituent sounds, and it will displease whenever we do not perceive that each sound is properly ordered in its place. The more often we are aware that sounds have departed from the order which we decide should control them, the more we are displeased. Hence, it can happen that some notice order not sensed by others, and thus the same thing can please some, displease others. Both groups can be deceived, for there can be order which many do not recognize. Then, too, some people seem to perceive order where there is none, and hence arise such diverse judgments about musical matters.

12. Thus those things please in which we perceive the existing order. We will be more pleased if offered several such things whose order we comprehend, and we will sense the greatest degree of agreeableness if we are aware of the order existing in relationships _among_ those things. It follows that if we do not perceive order in some of those things, our please is less; and if we note no order at all, then the particular object fails to please us. If we not only observe no order in an object but also perceive some things, beyond all reason, which disturb the order of which the object is perhaps capable, then we will be displeased and the experience will be almost painful. 

13. The more easily we observe the order in a given thing, the simpler and more perfect we consider it, and therefore we receive pleasure and delight from it. On the other hand, if the order is discerned with difficulty and seems less simple and distinct, we perceive something like sadness. In either case, as long as we sense order, the given object pleases, and we conclude that the object has agreeableness. This is seemingly inconsistent, since the same thing which moves the spirit to sadness can please and have agreeableness. If we consider the musical harmonies and melodies themselves we conceded that all should be agreeable and should please; yet we observe that some things are suitable for evoking joy and others are suitable for evoking sadness. Hence, there are two kinds of things which please: one which makes spirits happy and another which makes spirits sad.

14. Obviously, these are like comedies and tragedies, all of which should be filled with agreeableness. The comedy should fill the spirit with joy and the tragedy should convey sadness. Thus it is clear that something can please and evoke joy, and something else can please and bring sadness. We have already indicated that all things please in which we perceive order to be present. However, joy is conveyed by those things which have a simpler, more easily perceptible order, and sadness is conveyed by those things whose order is more complex and is more difficult to perceive.

15. These matters do not differ greatly from those which are usually treated by philosophers under the headings of joy and sadness. They describe joy as an extraordinary degree of pleasure. Thus more perfection is required for evoking joy than for mere pleasure. Their definition of sadness seems to differ greatly from ours, but note that here we do not speak of that sadness which is generally classified among the emotions arising from contemplation of the imperfect. For music, since it tries to please, neither intends nor is capable of such sadness. Thus sadness simply involves more difficult perception of perfection or order and differs from joy only in degree.

16. Tones have two main elements which can contain order: pitch and duration. Therefore, musical harmony pleases if we perceive the order existing among the sounds by virtue of their pitch and if we comprehend the order existing in the durations of the sounds. To pitch and duration we might add intensity as an element having order. Although musicians use this element in their compositions, making some sounds strong and some weak, still they do not seek agreeableness in the perception of the relationship or order which the degrees of intensity having among themselves. Hence, they do not usually try to define the quantity of intensity, for it is almost impossible.

17. Since order is the disposition of elements according to some fixed law, he who recognizes this law from inspection also perceives the order, and the perception itself will please him. in music quantities determine order. Whether we consider pitch or duration, either is determined by quantity. Pitch is determined by the frequency of the pulses produced in the air; duration, by the length of the time each tone is held. He who perceives the relation of the frequency of the pulses in tones understands the order of the tones and is pleased. Similarly, he who distinguishes and compares the durations of tones among themselves also perceives order and receives pleasure. How we perceive order in each category is to be explained clearly.

18. We perceive the relation between two given tones if we comprehend the ratio which exists between the numbers of pulses produced in the same span of time. Thus, if one tone has three pulses and another has two in a given period, we recognize the relation and order when we observe the sesquialteral ratio. Similarly, we comprehend the mutual relationships of several tones if we recognize all the ratios which exist between the numbers of vibrations produced in the same period. We also derive pleasure from tones of various durations if we perceive the ratios amont the lengths of the individual durations. Hence, it is clear that all pleasure in music arises from perception of the ratios among several numbers, since durations can also be expressed in numbers.<fn>The please contributed under the general heading of expression, not lending itself so readily to quantification, is excluded. See Section 35 of this chapter.</fn>

19. The perception of the ratios of tones is greatly facilitated by the fact that we perceive the many vibrations of the individual tones and are able to compare them with each other several times. Therefore, it is much easier to determine the ratio of two tones by hearing than it is to determine the ratio of the two lines by observation, even if the ratio is the same. The ratio of sounds and lines would be alike if we should receive only two pulses of each and should be forced to make a judgment about the relationship of their intervals. But since a great number of vibrations are produced by tones with reasonable durations, as we discussed in the preceding chapter, it can be seen how much easier the recognition of the ratio of tones becomes. Hence, very composite ratios can be used in music, but if these same ratios existed in lines, they would be difficult to determine visually. 

20. Since lower tones produce fewer pulses in the same time than higher tones, it is clear that the ratio of higher tones can be perceived more easily than that of lower tones, if each tone has the same duration. Therefore, other thing being equal, it is necessary that lower tones last longer and follow each other more slowly than in the case of higher tones, which can proceed more rapidly. Thus we have the general rule that a greater duration be assigned to the lower tones and a lesser duration to the higher tones. It is understood that the more composite and difficult of perception are the ratios among them, the more the one or the other must be prolonged. Hence, if the lower tones are to have simple ratios and the higher tones are to have composite ratios, the former should proceed more rapidly and the latter more slowly.

21. In order that the method of perceiving the order or ratio of two or more tones may be more easily understood, we have tried to visualize it in a figure, as far as it is possible. We represent the pulses in the air as dots placed in a straight line. The distances between the dots correspond to the intervals of the pulses. Several examples appear in Table I. By this process a sound of constant pitch is described by a series of equidistant dots as in Figure 1, in which, since a ratio of equality exists throughout, there is no doubt that the order is most easily understood. Hence, one sound or unison, as it is called, constitutes for us the first and simplest degree of perceiving order. We will call it the first degree of agreeableness, and it has the numerical ratio of 1:1.

[table 1]

22. Suppose our hearing is presented with two tones having a duple ratio. These may be represented by two series of dots, and the interval between the dots in one series would be twice that in the other series, as in Figure 2, where the higher and lower tones are represented by the upper and lower series, respectively. The order of these, considered at the same time, is also easily perceived, as is evident from inspection of the figure. Since it is the simplest after the unison, we designate this as the second degree of agreeableness, and it is expressed by the ratio 1:2. Similarly, Figure 3 shows the ratio 1:3, and Figure 4 shows 1:4. Which of these last two is the more easily perceived is disputable. The 3:1 ratio is expressed in smaller numbers, but the 4:1 ratio is easily perceived since it is the double of a duple ratio and hence its discernment is not much more difficult than the duple itself. For this reason, we place both in the third degree. 

23. Since the ratios 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4 belong to the first, second and third degrees of agreeableness, respectively, it is logical that we assign 1:8 to the fourth degree, 1:16 to the fifth, and so on, according to a duple geometric progression. Thus, the ratio 1:2ⁿ belongs to the degree (n+1). I chose this particular distribution because the degrees progress equally in ease of perception. Thus, the fifth degree is perceived with more difficulty than the fourth, which is perceived with more difficulty than the third, and so on. I designate no intermediate degrees with _n_ as a fraction since in this case the ratio would be irrational and impossible to recognize.

24. If the number associated with unity in one of these ratios is composite, i.e., has divisors, then the degree of agreeableness becomes smaller. We have observed that 1:4 should not be considered more composite than 1:3, even if 4 is larger than 3. On the other hand, it is clear that the degree of the agreeableness should be assigned according to the magnitude of the numbers themselves, if they are prime. Thus the ratio 1:5 is simpler than 1:7, although perhaps it is not simpler than 1:8. By induction we can make a conclusion concerning the prime number. Since 1:1 gives the first degree, 1:2 the second, and 1:3 the third, we conclude that 1:5 belongs to the fifth, 1:7 to the seventh, and in general, _1:p_, if _p_ is prime, to the degree which is indicated by the number _p_.

25. If the ratio _1:p_ is assigned to the degree indicated by _m_, we can conclude from section 23 that _1:2p_ belongs to the degree m+1, _1:4p_ to the degree m+2, and 1:(2ⁿ)p to the degree m+n. Thus, by the simple operation of halving or doubling, the degree of agreeableness is changed by unity. Similarly we can determine the degree of the ratio 1:pq, where _p_ and _q_ are prime numbers. _pq_ has the same ratio to _p_ as _q_ does to one. Therefore, the degree of 1:pq should exceed _p_ (or _q_) by the same number as _q_ (or _p_) exceeds 1. Hence, it will be _p+q-1_.

26. This same reasoning also holds in general, for if the ratio 1:_P_ belongs to the degree _p_ and 1:_Q_ belongs to the degree _q_, the ratio _1:PQ_ will belong to the degree _p+q-1_. Thus, the degrees of the constituent ratios must be added and unity subtracted from the sum. The ratio _1:pqr_ where _p_, _q_, and _r_ are prime numbers, is composed of 1:pq and 1:r with degrees of _p+q-1_ and _r_, respectively. The degree of _1:pqr_ will be _p+q+r-2_. Similarly, the degree of _1:pqrs_ will be _p+q+r+s-3_. The degree of _1:PQRS_ will be _P+Q+R+S-3_, if the degrees of _1:P_, _1:Q_, _1:R_, and _1:S_ are _p_, _q_, _r_, and _s_, respectively.

27. If _p_ is a prime number, if follows from the preceding that the degree of _1:p²_ is _2p-1_ and the degree of _1:p³_ is _3p-2_. In general, _1:pⁿ_ belongs to the degree _np-n+1_. Therefore, since _1:qᵐ_ belongs to the degree _mq-m+1_, according to the rule of the preceding section, 1:(pⁿ)(qᵐ) should be assigned to the degree _np+mq-n-m+1_. If _P_ is any number, the degree to which _1:P_ belongs can be found by finding the sum of the prime factors of _P_ and subtracting one less than the number of factors from the sum. Thus, to find the degree 1:72, we first find that 72=2·2·2·3·3. the sum of these factors is 12 and the number of factors is 5. By subtracting 4 from 12, we find that the degree of 1:72 is 8.

28. If we are given a ratio involving three numbers, such as _1:p:q_,<fn>In modern terminology a ratio of three or more terms is a _continued ratio_.</fn> where _p_ and _q_ are prime numbers, both _1:p_ and _1:q_ mus be perceived in it. But these two ratios together are perceived with the same ease as their composite, _1:pq_. Therefore, the degree of _1:p:q_ should be determined from the number _pq_ by the given rule. Similarly, the degree of _1:p:q:r_, where _p_, _q_, and _r_ are again prime numbers, can be found from the number _pqr_. Thus, if four given tones are expressed by the number 1:2:3:5, the degree is found from the number 30, which gives the eighth degree. 

29. These prime numbers should all be unequal, otherwise the computation is not valid. The ratio _1:p:p_, for example, is perceived as easily as _1:p_, for the two _p_'s can be considered as one, but _1:p:p_ should not be considered equivalent to _1:p²_. Similarly, if the numbers _p_, _q_, _r_, etc., are not prime, the computation is not valid. If  _p_, _q_, _r_, and _s_ are prime numbers, the ratio _1:pr:qr:ps_ is perceived by recognition of _1:p_, _1:q_, _1:r_, and _1:s_. Although they occur twice, 1:p and 1:r are used once. Hence, the degree should be determined from the composite ratio _1:pqrs_ or from the number _pqrs_.

30. If we consider not only the number _pqrs_ itself but also the method of obtaining it, we discover that this number is the least common multiple of the numbers _1_, _pr_, _qr_, and _ps_, or the smallest number which can be divided by each of the numbers constituting the given ratio. From this we draw a universal rule for identifying the degree of agreeableness in perceiving the ratio of several numbers taken together. The least common multiple should be found, and from this number the degree of agreeableness is determined by the rule given in Section 27. The degree of the resulting least common multiple is shown in the table given in Section 31. I have not continued the table beyond the sixteenth degree, since numbers belonging to higher degrees rarely occur.

31. In this able Roman numerals denote the degree of agreeableness and the usual figures represent all least common multiples belonging to it:

32. Of the several ways to find the least common multiple, there is one which will be most useful for our purpose. The given numbers are resolved into their prime factors, and the least common multiple is the product formed by taking each factor to the highest power to which it is found in any of the given numbers. For example, if the given numbers are 72, 80, 100, and 112, they can be resolved into the factors 2³·3², 2⁴·5, 2²·5², and 2⁴·7. The distinct prime factors are 2, 3, 5 and 7, whose highest powers are 4, 2, 2, and 1 respectively. Therefore, the least common multiple is 2⁴·3²·5²·7 or 25,200 which belongs to the twenty-third degree.

33. Hence, applying the above rules to any numbers whatever, we can determine the degree of difficulty or ease in perceiving their mutual ratio and order. We can also compare several cases and judge which of them is most easily perceived. The given ratio should consist of the smallest possible integers. Obviously, no such order exists in irrational numbers. The finding of the lease common multiple does not pertain to fractions. If the numbers were fractions, they could be changed into integers without changing their mutual relationship. The ratios should be expressed in the smallest possible numbers, so that unity is the only number which is a factor of all. If they are not the smallest, they must be divided by their highest common factor.

34. in this way, also, we can determine the degree of agreeableness of ratios which are not multiple and which are first considered. Thus, since its least common multiple is six, the ratio 2:3 belongs to the fourth degree and is perceived with the same ease as 1:6 or 1:8 (Figure 5). This perception corresponds to the inspection of the points of this figure, in which the order is easily perceived. Obviously, ratios belonging to higher degrees will be perceived with much more difficulty in such a figure. For example, if the ratio 5:7 were expressed in such a figure, its order would be quite difficult to perceive. The larger the number by which the degree is expressed, the more difficult the order is to perceive from this kind of figure.

35. Finally, this method of determining the perception of order has an even wider application. We have applied it to tones of different pitch, but it can be applied to tones of various durations by expressing the tones in numbers proportional to the durations. But, in the case of durations, we can not use such advanced degrees as we used in our examination of pitch, since in the latter the pulses occur more frequently and their relationship is hence more easily perceived. Perception of ratio in the case of several tones differing in duration is similar to the observation of lines whose mutual relationship must be comprehended visually. If those things which constitute order can be quantified and expressed in numbers, the treatment described herein will have great usefulness in all other matters in which beauty and order are present, as, for example, in architecture, where beauty of form necessitates that all parts of the structure be arranged in an order which can be perceived.


CHAPTER III

ON MUSIC IN GENERAL

1. A definition of music may seem unnecessary at this point, since everyone knows what field is designated by that name, Yet I believe that a definition appropriate to my purpose will be of great utility for the division of the work and for the method of treating each part of the work. Therefore, I define music as the scientific process of joining together various tones so as to produce harmony pleasing to the ear. For this reason, I decided that the science of sounds and of the principles of harmony should be set forth in some detail in the preceding chapters so as to give a sound basis for understanding the definition itself and the method of treatment.

2. Music is most often divided into two parts, one theoretical, the other practical. The theoretical part deals with musical composition and is designated by the special name _harmony_. The practical part deals with the vocal of instrumental production of the prescribed tones, and to this part the name music is commonly applied. It follows that the theoretical part is the principal one since the other part can do nothing without it. One the other hand, the theoretical cannot attain its end, pleasure, without the practical. However, since the practical part is nothing but the treatment of musical instruments we will not concern ourselves with it here. 

3. We have mentioned two elements of tone which can convey agreeableness: pitch and duration. If one carefully examines the music of today, he will observe that all its agreeableness comes from the variety of pitches and the duration of the tones. It cannot be denied that the intensity range of the tones contributes much agreeableness. The measure of this intensity is not usually prescribed and the listener cannot estimate it very exactly. It is usually left to the judgment of the performer. Thus, we cannot reckon with intensity as we can with pitch and duration. In general, however, it can be observed that  those tones which have greater emphasis should also be given greater intensity.

4. The diversity of musical instruments can also bring much agreeableness, and the kind of instrument used for a given melody is very important. One melody requires a harp, another, the violin, another, the flute. Still another may be more suitable for the horn or the trumpet. Not only do these instruments differ in tone quality, but some of them can execute a given series of tones more easily and gracefully. For this reason, composers should be careful about their choices of instruments, so that they write nothing that cannot be executed properly and gracefully. Hence, for the most part, composers designate instruments best fitted for playing their melodies.

5. Having admitted pitch and duration as two conveyors of agreeableness, we can add their combination as a third. Firstly, all agreeableness could come from the diversity of high and low tones, with all durations equal or ignored. Secondly, even if we make all pitches the same, the tones can still convey agreeableness because of the order existing in their duration. Third, the most perfect degree of agreeableness comes from the variety of pitches and durations used together, and it follows that excellent music is characterized by a high degree of such variety.

6. In this third category belongs most of present-day music. Modern composers not only use variety of pitches to produce agreeableness, but they increase it considerably by use of variety of duration, from which the measure has its origin. Let us examine examples of the first two kinds of agreeableness. All the agreeableness found in ecclesiastical plainchant comes from the variety of pitches and from the proper succession of consonances. Drums give us an example of agreeableness of duration. Since their sounds differ little in pitch, all agreeableness ultimately depends on the variety of duration. 

7. In all these categories the composer should consider not only the general rules of agreeableness but also whether he desires to move his hearers to joy or sadness. In the preceding chapter it was pointed out how each may be effected. In composing melodies to given hymns the composer must give attention to these matters. If words or sentences of sadness occur, a melody is usually provided so that the order is perceived with more difficulty. Hence, composers use less simple consonances or successions of them which are more difficult of perception, or they prepare the durations so that the perception of their ratios is made more difficult. When the text tends of gaiety, they reverse these procedures. 

8. A musical composition is like an oration or a poem. In these it is not sufficient just to join together elegant words and phrases, but they should have a well-ordered arrangement and appropriate theme. Such a purpose should also be evident in music. Several consonances connected in a series will not often please, even if the individual consonances are quite agreeable, but order must be evident, just as if the consonances were to constitute a speech. It is especially necessary to observe the degree of ease or difficulty with which the order is perceived. As the purpose requires, the gaiety or sadness will have to be interchanged, or now one, then the other will have to be intensified or relaxed.

9. Now, let us consider how best to treat these three kinds of music. All of the first kind consists of the succession of the various pitches, since, as we have said, any order of duration is either absent or is not considered. Often in this category several tones sound simultaneously, and the resulting sound is called a consonance. I do not mean consonance in the usual sense as the opposite of dissonance, but I use this word to designate that sound produced by several simultaneous tones. With this definition, a simple tone can be considered as the lowest and simplest degree of consonance, just as unity is situated among the integers. The first kind of music, then, consists of a series of several consecutive consonances which constitute agreeable harmony.

10. Therefore, the first object of discussion and investigation should be the kinds of sound required for making an agreeable consonance. Then we should ascertain the degree of agreeableness in each case. Many kinds of consonances will be studied, and later we will indicative those most suitable for use. We will investigate the relationship between two chords whose succession is pleasing. Finally, we will find out about the relative nature of of several consecutive consonances. With these studied completed, we will be able to determine how much agreeableness is contained in any given series of consonances, for we will have considered individual consonances, their successions, and the relations between the successions.

11. Next, we will have methods of composing many series of consonances. Those methods in use by composers are only special cases. Since each of these requires certain tones, we must consider the instruments capable of produce these tones. Next, there is a fuller treatment of musical modes, their successions, and other matters by which a musical composition is determined and encompassed. Finally, we will re-examine the simple components of consonances and will diligently investigate the kinds which should be used at a particular time, their interchange and appropriate substitutions. A composition which is limited only by these rules and which neglects the duration of tones, is usually called simple or free, since in a measure it is similar to free verse lacking any meter.

12. Another kind of music disregards the differences in pitch and is wholly concerned with producing agreeableness through the duration of tones. This agreeableness, as was pointed out in Chapter II, will be obtained if we can perceive the ratio and order which the durations of the individual tones have among themselves. Therefore, all tones must have measured, fixed durations which should be so related that their ratios are perceptible. Starting with two tones, we should find out what duration they should have in order that the listeners can perceive their ratio. Here, too, it will be very helpful to note by what degree of ease such ratios can be perceived. Similarly, we will consider more than two tones. 

13. Just as the division of time into equal parts is used everywhere and seems quite natural to man, all tones in music are based on equal divisions of time, even if the tones themselves have unequal durations. With time divided into equal parts, the tones are so distributed that partial sums of their durations are equal to the equal parts. Thus, in the same period of time, there may be many or few tones, depending on their durations. Such a portion of time is called a measure. Accordingly, a series of tones in the kind of music under consideration is distributed in such measures, which are distinguished from each other as are feet and verses in a poem. 

14. A measure is distinguished either by its duration or by its subdivisions. In the first case, the measure passes slowly or rapidly, depending on its length. In the case of subdivisions, which can be made in many ways, the variety of possibilities is manifold. This variety can result from division of the measure into 2, 3, or 4 parts, and there will also be diversity arising from the equal or unequal divisions of each part. Also, these parts themselves are often further subdivided in various ways. From this there arises--in this kind of music, at least--such great diversity that no list of the varieties can be made.

15. Then, too, successive measures often vary either in duration or subdivisions, so that sometimes we have a slow one after a fast one and sometimes a fast one after a slow one. In the case of subdivisions, the bipartite, tripartite, and other measures can be altered and intermixed in many ways. This variety, moreover, may be greatly increased since for the same division a measure may be of different kinds and these kinds can have a variety of subdivisions. Moreover, by the simultaneous variation of both divisions and durations, the number of changes will be increased enormously. The rules governing all these matters are to be derived from Chapter II.

16. As we have said, measures and their parts are perceived by the hearers in the same manner as the verses, feet, and syllables of a poem. Just as in these there is scarcely any perceptible cessation of the words when they are read, even if some gap is actually present, thus measures and their parts are distinguished from each other, so that a very short and almost imperceptible space may be interposed between measures and between parts. Frequently, the difference of intensity of tones accentuates this distinction, for the first tones of a measure, or those which begin the measure or its parts, are made stronger. Hence, the first tones in any measure and its parts should be the most prominent, and the other tones should be less prominent.

17. Just as the parts of a measure can be compared with the individual syllables of a poem and the measure itself with the feet or verses, so also several measures constitute a whole sentence and several such sentences make up part of a poem. Therefore, similar rules should be observed in music and rhetoric, so that any measure may represent a certain division of the melody; and several measures, which correspond to the sentence or verse of a poem, should comprise a complete melodic thought. This thought should have an appropriate close. There should be a diversity of such closes, depending on whether they end a part of a sentence, a whole sentence, or a whole work.

18. The last tone of each sentence should be prominent, and hence it should be the first tone of either a measure or of a beat. Therefore, neither a musical sentence nor a poem can finish at the very end of the measure itself, but each should conclude at the beginning of a measure or of its parts. The progression toward, and preparation for, the close occurs in the very end of the measure or its part so that the following prominent tone concludes the sentence. Secondary tones are used to join together the prominent tones. They should be placed among the prominent tones, and they can neither begin nor end a melody. All of these matters will receive fuller treatment in the investigation of the third kind of music.

19. The third kind of music, as we have said, joins the other two kinds. This third kind will have much agreeableness when the tones have perceptible order in the matter of pitch, as in the first kind, and in the matter of duration, as in the second kind. Therefore, the greater the order existing in each, the more this music will please. Clearly, it is much more difficult in this third kind to work out something of perfection jointly. Hence, the very nature of the matter requires hat work and study be given to the first two kinds before the third is considered, for unless agreeableness can be obtained in each of the first two kinds separately, nothing agreeable will be found in the first, which is composed of the first two. If the first two are understood, the third should present little difficulty.

20. In this third kind lies the greatest variety of composition, for it has available not only the varieties of each of the other two, but an almost infinite number resulting from combination of the two. If the total number of arrangements in the first kind is _m_ and the number of different forms of the measure in the second kind is _n_, the number of varieties of the third kind will be _mn_. As we have shown, if _m_ and _n_ approach infinity, the number of _mn_ will be of stupendous magnitude. Clearly, all the possible varieties of modern music, which is principally of the third kind, could not be enumerated. Thus, that art cannot be exhausted, and, as long as the world endures, there will always be new inventions in the greatest abundance, from which there will be a constant flow of new kinds of melody and harmony.<fn>John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), English philosopher and economist, wrote: "I was seriously tormented by the thought of the exhaustibility of musical combinations. The octave which consists only of five tones and two semitones, which can be put together in only a limited number of ways of which but a small proportion are beautiful: most of these, it seemed to me, must have been already discovered, and there could not be room for a long succession of Mozarts and Webers to strike out, as these have done, entirely new surpassing rich veins of musical beauty. This sort of anxiety may, perhaps, be thought to resemble that of the philosophers of Laputa, who feared lest the sun be burnt out." See Slonimsky, Nicolas, _Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns_, p. vi.</fn>

21. In treating the third kind of music, it is convenient to follow the division made in the second kind and to apply to each variety of measure all the methods of composing the first kind. First of all, however, we should consider the general rules for combining the first two kinds of music. These rules should show what kinds of consonances are most suitable in any part of a measure. Since some parts of a measure are more prominent and some are less prominent, it is necessary that such a discrimination be made among those consonances which are used. Since a group of measures is comparable to the sentence and other parts of a poem, we should also show the kinds of consonances by which any division may be most suitably expressed. Here we should also deal with endings and their differences which arise from the division.

22. Next, by enumerating the various kinds of measures from the second kind of music, we will indicate how musical sentence can be constructed and how a whole poem, as it were, can be composed of them. This discussion will be quite extended because the kinds of measures and the methods of composing are innumerable. in addition, there is a great diversity of style, which is an element for consideration in music as well as rhetoric and which is nothing but a certain system of forming sentences and joining them together. Here, too, belong musical figures, similar to figures in rhetoric, by which these musical discourses are highly embellished and brought to the topmost degree of perfection.

23. From the consonances which thus compose musical harmony, there arise different voices, as they are called. If the tones are produced either by the human voice or by an instrument which can produce only one tone at a tine, the production of any consonance requires several voices or such instruments. This gives rise to a new treatment of the combining of several voices so as to produce a series of appropriate and pleasing consonances. We should first consider one voice, then two, three, four, or more. By this process, all rules which will be brought out will be most highly accommodated to the usual method of composing. Almost all works of music consist of a certain number of voices, each of which constitutes a certain incomplete melody. Sounded together, however, they produce an agreeable harmony.

24. Thus, the full treatment of music will be completed in three parts, corresponding to the kinds of music. It is clear how any of these may be referred to the rules of harmony established in Chapter II. Since everything pertaining to music can be derived from certain principles whose truth has been adequately established, the method which we shall use is clearly philosophic or rational. No one, as far as I know, has used such a method in discussing music. all who have written about music have slighted either theory or practice. Some how have drawn up rules for composing without demonstrations. Others have busied themselves explaining consonances and dissonances, following which they have investigated the tuning of musical instruments; but they have used inadequate or uncertain principles, and accordingly, their progress has been limited.

CHAPTER IV

ON CONSONANCES

1. Several tones occurring simultaneously constitute a composite sound which we call a _consonance_. Others define this term in a stricter sense and say that a consonance denotes a composite sound which is pleasing to the hearing and has much agreeableness in itself, and they distinguish such a consonance from a dissonance, which for them is a composite sound having little or no agreeableness. But since it is difficult to define the limits of consonance and dissonance and since this distinction is less in agreement with our method of treatment by which we judge composite sounds according to the degrees of agreeableness as set forth in Chapter II, we apply the terms _consonance_ to all sounds which consist of several simultaneous tones.

2. Therefore, whenever such a consonance is pleasing, the ratios among its component sounds must be perceived. Since we are not concerned here with the duration of sounds, the agreeableness will be derived only from the perception of the differences in the highness and lowness of the sounds. Therefore, since the highness and lowness of the sounds are measured from the number of pulses produced in the same period of time, it is clear that anyone who comprehends the mutual relationship of these numbers should also sense the agreeableness of the consonance.

3. We decided earlier to express the pitches themselves by the number of vibrations associated with each pitch, using the calculation of highness or lowness to measure the sound as a quantity or to determine its position. Accordingly, whenever a given consonance pleases, it is necessary that the ratio between the sounds as individual quantities be perceived by the hearer. In this way, therefore, we refer the perception of consonances to a consideration of numbers, a matter treated in Chapter II, from which one can understand how the agreeableness of any consonance is to be judged. 

4. It will be simple, therefore, to reduce the perception of any consonance to a certain degree of agreeableness. This will make clear the degree of difficulty or ease with which a given consonance is comprehended. In addition, several consonances can be compared with each other, and it will be possible to decide which are comprehended more easily and to what degree. Therefore, given any consonance, one must find a number which is the least common multiple of the numbers representing the individual sounds and must ascertain to which degree this multiple belongs. From this it will be clear how much perceptive ability is required.

5. Therefore, since we want the least common multiple of the simple sounds, we will always have to express these pitches in integers which must be the smallest having the same ratio; and this will be the case if the integers have no common divisor except unity. We should next seek the least common multiple in accordance with the principles set forth in Chapter II. Finally, using these same principles, we find the degree of agreeableness to which the least common multiple belongs. The perception of the consonance itself should be rated as belonging to the same degree. Our table in Chapter II gives the least common multiple associated with the first 16 degrees.

6. Henceforth the term _exponent_ will be used to designated the least common multiple of the simple sounds composing a consonance. With this designation the nature of the consonance itself is ascertained at once. In Section 27, Chapter II, a method was described for finding the degree of agreeableness from the given exponent. The formula may be expressed by _s-n+1_, where _s_ is the sum of the prime factors of the exponent and _n_ is the number of these factors. The smaller the number yielded by this formula, the more agreeable or more easily perceived is the consonance under consideration.

7. Appropriately, the consonances are classified according to the number of simple sounds of which they are composed. Thus there are bisonant, trisonant, and multisonant consonances, according to whether they consist of two, three, or more sounds. Hence, bisonant consonances consist of two tones, _a_ and _b_, numbers by which may be expressed the ratio of the sounds. These numbers must be integers with no common factors. Therefore, the least common multiple will be the number _ab_, which will be the exponent of the given consonance and will signify the degree of agreeableness to which this consonance belongs. Let us list such consonances according to the degree of agreeableness so that the degrees of ease or difficulty of perception may be clear from the order itself.

8. To make such an enumeration, let us resolve each number of each degree in the table of Chapter II into two numbers with no common factors. In many instances there are several such pairs, each of which represents the sounds of a bisonant consonance whose exponent is the number from which these pairs of factors are derived. For example, in the fifth degree we have the number 12 which can be resolved in two ways into relatively prime factors: 1, 12 and 3, 4. Such sounds, therefore, constitute consonances which belong to the fifth degree and have an exponent of 12.

9. It will be noted that no bisonant or multisonant consonance is represented in the first degree, to which unity belongs, for since the sounds constituting a consonance must be different, a unity of sounds can never be a least common multiple or exponent. For this reason the simplest consonance belongs to the second degree and consists of tones having a 1:2 ratio. The exponent is 2, which is the only number belonging to the second degree. Musicians call this consonance the diapason or octave and consider it the simplest and most perfect, for it is the most easily perceived and distinguished from the other consonances by the hearing.

10. The third degree has the numbers 3 and 4, each of which is resolved into two relatively prime factors., i.e., 1, 3 and 1, 4. These pairs produce bisonant consonances belonging to the third degree and consisting of tones with ratios of 1:3 and 1:4, usually called the octave plus fifth and the double octave, respectively. There can be no doubt that these consonances are more easily perceived than those that follow.

11. Proceeding in this manner, I made the following table of bisonant consonances arranged according to degree of agreeableness and carried through the tenth degree:

Degree II: 1:2.
III: 1:3, 1:4.
IV: 1:6, 2:3, 1:8.
V: 1:5, 1:9, 1:12, 3:4, 1:16.
VI: 1:10, 2:5, 1:18, 2:9, 1:24, 3:8, 1:32
VII: 1:7, 1:15, 3:5, 1:20, 4:5, 1:27, 1:36, 4:9, 1:48, 3:16, 1:64.
VIII: 1:14, 2:7, 1:30, 2:15, 3:10, 5:6, 1:40, 5:8, 1:54, 2:27, 1:72, 8:9, 1:96, 3:32, 1:128.
IX: 1:21, 3:7, 1:25,1:28, 4:7, 1:45, 5:9, 1:60, 3:20, 4:15, 5:12, 1:80, 9:16, 1:192, 3:64, 1:256.
X: 1:42, 3:14, 6:7, 1:50, 2:25, 1:56, 7:8, 1:90, 2:45, 5:18, 9:10, 1:120, 1:162, 2:81, 1:216, 8:27, 1:288, 9:32, 1:384, 3:128, 1:512.

12. Since we know from Section 11, Chapter I, how to stretch two strings so that they produce tones having a given ratio, it will be a simple matter to produce these consonances with strings and to test each of them as to difficulty or ease of perception. Such experiments will be found to offer substantial agreement with our theory, and I believe that they are very useful and highly necessary for exercising the hearing of music student; for, by such process, he will be able to compare for himself the distinct impressions of these simple consonances and will emerge better fitted for the actual practice of music.

13. Yet, it is not necessary for one to have distinct impressions of all the enumerated consonances, but it is sufficient for him to have in mind well-defined conceptions of the simple consonances, which are 1:2, 1:3 or 2:3, 1:5 or 2:5 or 4:5. For if one knows not only how to distinguish these consonances from the others but also how to produce them, with the help of hearing, either by the voice or by strings, he can also produce by ear all the remaining consonances whose exponents have no divisors except 2, 3, and 5. This will be quite adequate for the music of our day and for tuning instruments. I will go into more detail later.

14. I have already mentioned that I include the so-called consonances and dissonances under the term _consonance_. By the use of the table and our system it is possible to a certain extent to delimit these two categories, for dissonances belong to the higher degrees and consonances belong to the lower degrees. Thus, a bisonant sound having an 8:9 ratio and belonging to the eighth degree is included with the dissonances; a ditone or major third with a 4:5 ratio belongs to the seventh degree and is included with the consonances. But we cannot conclude from this that the eighth degree is the beginning of the dissonances, for in this same degree are included the ratios 5:6 and 5:8, which are not considered as dissonances. 

15. If this matter is considered more carefully, it will be clear that differentiation between consonances and dissonances should be based not only on the ease of perception but also on the whole process of composition. For those consonances with can be used less fittingly in compositions are called dissonances even if they are more easily perceived than others which are called consonances. This explains why the major second, 8:9, is included with the dissonances while other much more composite consonances are classified as consonances. In like manner, the fourth or diatessaron, 3:4, is included by the musicians in the dissonances rather than in the consonances, notwithstanding the fact that it can be perceived quite easily.

16. As their writings make clear, the musicians of old considered the fourth a very pleasant consonance, but their criteria for separating consonances from dissonances certainly were not so firmly based on the nature of the matter itself but were deduced from dubious principles. For the Pythagoreans a consonance consisted of two tones having a ratio of either multiple or superparticular or multiple superparticular; and a dissonance consisted of two sounds having a ratio either superpartient or multiple superpartient.

17. In his _Libri Harmonicorum_ Ptolemy refutes this opinion of the Pythagoreans by adducing experience as evidence that the diapason diatessaron, 3:8, is a consonance, even though it is a duplex superpartient. Then he observes that the Pythagoreans themselves did not dare to use the rule punctiliously. For producing consonances they used nothing but duple, triple, quadruple, sesquialteral and sesquitertial ratios when they could have used innumerable others, equally justifiable according to their rule. I find no fault with Ptolemy's refutation, for it has regard, not for the kinds of ratios, but for the simplicity and ease of perception.

18. And yet, Ptolemy's own principle in this matter is no more veritable, for, after the diapason and disdiapason, he admits only two consonances: 2:3 or diapente and 3:4 or diatessaron. If these are combined, a 2:1 ratio results. He adds another law: Any consonance increased by an octave remains a consonance and loses nothing of its agreeableness. Thus he admits these are consonances: 1:2, 1:4, 2:3, 1:3, 3:4, and 3:8.

19. Nonetheless, Ptolemy gives considerable prerogative to the superparticular ratios over the superpartients, for sounds having superparticular ratios other than 2:3 and 3:4 are not classified by him as dissonant, but concinnous, meaning somewhere between consonant and dissonant. He boldly decided to classify the superpartient ratios--except 3:8--as dissonances. His method of measuring the agreeableness of sounds is very doubtful and is based on no sound principles. Since the truth of our principles has been sufficiently established, I do not believe it necessary to refute Ptolemy's method. Finally, I should set forth the views in this matter of the other school of ancient musicians, led by Aristoxenus. Just as they summarily rejected the ratios of numbers, they also left the judgment of dissonances to the senses alone; and in this they differed greatly from the Pythagoreans.

20. Since we can make a table of trisonant and multisonant consonances arranged according to the degree of agreeableness just as we did in the case of the bisonant consonances, any lengthy explanation about them seems unnecessary. It may be observed that the simplest trisonant consonance belongs to the third degree of agreeableness and consists of the tones 1:2:4 with an exponent of 4. From this it is obvious that the more tones a consonance consist of, the higher the degree of agreeableness to which it belongs, even if it is the simplest of its kind.

21. Hence, I will not discuss further this division of consonances, especially since I can proceed with the much more suitable and useful classification consisting of _complete_ and _incomplete_ consonances. I call a consonance _complete_ if no tone can be superimposed without changing the consonance itself to a higher degree or without making the exponent more composite. An example is the consonance consisting of the sounds 1:2:3:6, whose exponent is 6. Note that any superimposed sound makes the exponent larger. On the other hand, I consider a consonance incomplete if one or more tones can be added without increasing the exponent. An example is the consonance 1:2:3, which is incomplete since its exponent does not become larger even if the sound 6 is added. 

22. From the foregoing, it is clear that any number representing a simple tone is a divisor of the exponent of the consonance of which the tone is a part. Therefore, if we express all the simple tones represented by all divisors of an exponent, we will have the _complete_ consonance of that exponent; for there will be no other number which divides this exponent. Thus, a consonance which consisting of the tones 1:2:3:4:6:12 will be complete since only these numbers are divisors of 12, the exponent of this consonance.

23. Therefore, whenever the exponent of a consonance is a prime number, the complete consonance will be bisonant as represented by 1:a where _a_ denotes the prime number. If the exponent is aᵐ, the complete consonance will consist of m+1 tones, namely:
	1:a:a²:a³:...:aᵐ
If the exponent has the form _ab_, where _a_ and _b_ are prime numbers, the complete consonance will be quadrisonant:
	1:a:b:ab
If the form of the exponent is (aᵐ)(bⁿ), the complete consonance will have _mn+m+n+1_ tones. More generally, if the exponent is (aᵐ)(bⁿ)(c^p), the complete consonance will have (m+1)(n+1)(p+1) tones, and, according to the rule given in Section 6, it will belong to the degree
	_ma+nb+pc+m-n-p+1_;
for the sum of all the prime factors of the exponent is _ma+nb+pc_ and the number of factors is _m+n+p_.

24. From the above method of forming a complete consonance, it is clear that if one or more tones are omitted from such combination, an incomplete consonance is formed. Here we note that the omitted tones should not be such that the exponent becomes simpler. For example, if we omit 1 or 4 from the consonance 1:2:4, of which the exponent is 4, then the consonance would be 1:2 or 2:4, and the exponent in each case would be 2, not 4. However, we may omit the middle tone, 2, for the exponent of the consonance 1:4 is still 4, just as in the case of the complete consonance 1:2:4.

25. If the exponent is a prime number, it is clear that a consonance cannot be made incomplete since it consists only of two tones, but all of the remaining consonances can be made incomplete and bisonant by omitting all tones except the highest and the lowest; for since the highest is expressed by the exponent itself and the lowest by unity, the exponent of this bisonant consonance will not be simpler than that of the complete consonance. For example, if we omit tones 2 and 3 from the consonance 1:2:3:6, the exponent of the consonance 1:6 remains the same: 6. In the case of a consonance whose exponent is of the form aᵐ, neither the lowest tone 1 nor the highest tone aᵐ can be omitted; but in all of the remaining consonances, either the lowest or the highest or both can be omitted and the exponent will remain the same.

26. If a consonance is so constituted that none of its tones can be omitted without making the consonance simpler and reducing it to a lower degree, we shall call it a _pure_ consonance. Any bisonant consonance falls in this category since it ceases to be a consonance if either of its tones is omitted. Examples of pure consonances are 3:4:5, 4:5:6, 1:6:9, 2:3:12, from which no tones can be omitted without making the consonances simpler. Therefore, such a consonance can be found by reducing the number of sounds as far as possible without making the exponent smaller.

27. There are two methods by which any consonance can be made simpler by omitting one or more tones. One method is to make the omissions so that the least common multiple of the remaining tones-- or of the numbers expressing their relationship-- is less than that of all the numbers. For example, in the case of the consonance 2:3:5:6, if sound 5 is omitted, the least common multiple of the remaining 2:3:6 is 6, whereas it was originally 30. The other method is to make the omissions so that the remaining tones have a common divisor by which they must be divided before the least common multiple or exponent is determined. For example, in the case of the consonance 2:3:4:6, by omitting tone 3 and dividing by 2, we have the consonance 1:2:3, whose exponent is 6, compared with 12 for the original combination.

28. By using both methods at once in omitting one or more tones, it is also possible to make a consonance simpler, since then, of course, the numbers of the remaining sounds have both a simpler least common multiple and a common factor. For example, consider the consonance 3:6:8:9:12, of which the exponent is 72. If 8 is omitted, the least common multiple of th remaining 3:6:9:12 is 36, but since each of these numbers is divisible by 3, the resulting consonance may be considered to consist of the tones 1:2:3:4 with an exponent of 12. Thus the given consonance becomes much simpler by the omission of the single number 8.

29. In order that it may be more clearly understood just how a given consonance can be made simpler, let us consider a complete consonance with an exponent of _(aᵐ)P_, where _P_ is a quantity consisting of the product of any prime number except _a_. In this case, if we omit all tones expressed by _aᵐ_ and its multiples, there will remain a simpler consonance with an exponent of _a^(m-1)P_, which is a reduction made by the first method given above. By the second method, the consonance becomes simpler if all tones which are expressed by numbers not having _a_ as a factor are omitted, for then all of the remaining tones can be divided by _a_ and their exponent will be _a^(m-1)_. From this it is clear how a consonance can be made simpler by using both methods at once.

30. It is easily understood that the difference we hear between the complete and incomplete consonances lies in the fact that we comprehend the complete consonances much more distinctly than the incomplete ones. The relationships between the individual tones of a complete consonance are clearer than those between the tones of an incomplete consonance with the same exponent. Thus the exponent 6 of the consonance 1:2:3:6 is more distinctly perceived than the same exponent from 1:6 only. This is true, however, only when the tones correspond exactly to the numbers by which they are expressed.

31. It seems appropriate to add the following table of all the complete consonances contained in the first 12 degrees. Roman numerals designate the degree; Arabic numerals, the consonances belonging to each degree.

[long table page 116-117]

32. Although we comprehend the complete consonance more distinctly than the incomplete, yet, unless they are quite simple, the complete consonances are not employed. In the first place, if musical instruments are not tuned with absolute accuracy--and this is nowise obtainable--such a large number of sounds strike the ears more as a confused noise than as distinct harmony. Then, too, there is that great number of sounds which cannot be heard because they are either too high or too low; for in Chapter I it is shown that no sound which has fewer than 30 or more than 7500 vibrations per second can be heard. From this it is clear that whenever the extreme sounds of a consonance have a ratio exceeding 250:1, not all of its sounds will be heard.

33. It is appropriate at this point to relate to the principle of consonances those things which musicians include under _intervals_. We call an interval that distance which is considered to exist between two tones, one of which is higher than the other. The larger this interval is, the more the tones differ from high to low or the greater is the ratio of the higher tone to the lower. Thus, the interval of the tones 1:3 is larger than that of 1:2; and no interval exists between equal tones 1:1, since there is no intervening distance. From this it is clear that an interval must have some degree of difference between its higher and lower tones.

34. Consider the tones _a:b:c_, where _c_ is the highest, _a_ is the lowest, and _b_ any intermediate tone. It will be clear from the preceding definition that the interval of the tones _a_ and _c_ is the sum of the intervals between _b_ and _c_. Therefore, if these two intervals between _a_ and _b_ and between _b_ and _c_ are equal-- and they _are_ equal when _a:b=b:c_--the interval _a:c_ will be twice as larger as the interval _a:b_ or _b:c_. From this it is clear that the interval 1:4 is twice as larger as the interval 1:2. Since 1:2 is considered an octave, the ratio 1:4 comprises two octaves.

35. Anyone who considers these matters more carefully will have no difficulty in understanding that intervals should be expressed by the measures of the ratios which exist between the tones. Ratios are measured by logarithms of fractions whose numerators denote the higher tones and whose denominators denote the lower tones. Therefore, the interval between the sounds _a:b_ is expressed by the logarithm of the fraction _b/a_. This is usually written log(b/a). And equivalent expression is log(b)-log(a). Therefore, as we have already mentioned, there is no interval between the equal sounds a:a, inasmuch as as it is expressed by log(a)-log(a) = 0.

36. Thus the interval which is called the octave, since it comes from sounds having a duple ratio, is expressed by log 2; and the interval of the sounds 2:3, which is called the fifth or diapente, will be log(3/2) or log(3)-log(2). From this it is clear that these intervals are incommensurable, for there is no way to assign the ratio of log(2) to log (3/2); and for this reason there is no interval, however small, which divides and octave and a fifth into equal parts. It is the same with the ratios of all other intervals which are expressed by incommensurable logarithms, such as log(3/2) and log(5/4). On the other hand, we _can_ compare those intervals expressible by the logarithms of numbers which are powers of the same quantity. Thus, if we compare the interval 27:8 to that of 9:4, we find a ratio 3:2, for log(27/8) = 3 log(3/2) and log(9/4)= 2 log(3/2).

37. By using this same logarithmic measurement, we can easily determine which intervals arise from the addition or subtraction of various intervals, for the resulting logarithm indicates the interval which is produced. For example, if we want the interval which is left after subtracting the fifth from the octave, we must subtract log (3/2) (or log(3) - log(2) ) from log(2). The remainder is log(2)-log(3)+log(2), i.e., 2 log(2) - log(3). But 2 log(2) = log(4), and the remaining interval will be log(4) - log(3), or log(4/3), which is called the diatessaron or fourth. If it is added to the fifth, a whole octave is the result.

38. Although the logarithms of various numbers cannot be compared with each other unless they are powers of the same quantity, it is possible to arrive at approximate ratios with the help of a table of logarithms and thus intervals can be compared with each other to the limits of these approximations. Therefore, since the measure of the octave is log(2), which is .3010300 according to the table, and since the fifth is log(3)-log(2), or .1760913, the ratio of the octave to the fifth will be approximately .3010300/.1760913. In order to reduce this to smaller numbers, this ratio is changed into the following fraction:<fn>A continued fraction. Euler's _De fractionibus continuis_ (1737) was the first great memoir on this subject. See Smith, D. E., _History of Mathematics_,Vol. II, p. 421. Euler's accomplishment in this treatise precedes by other a century that of M. W. Drobisch (1802-1892), who used 46797/80000 as the ratio of the fifth to the octave and obtained a continued fraction expansion credited by Barbour as "the first really scientific method of dividing the octave with regard to the principal consonances, the thirds and the fifths." (Barbour, J. M., "Music and Ternary Continued Fractions," _American Mathematical Monthly_, LV (1948), 548. See also the same author's _Tuning and Temperament_, p. 130.) See Appendix C for an analysis of Euler's fraction.</fn>

[continued fraction here]

From this we can derive the simple ratios
2:1, 3:2, 5:3, 7:4, 12:7, 17:10, 29:17, 41:24, 53:31,
of which the last is the closest to the true ratio.

39. In a similar manner, intervals can be divided into any desired number of equal parts and we can designate almost the exact pitches which are separated from each other by such equal divisions. We must divide the logarithm of the given interval into the given number of parts and take from the tables the corresponding number which represents one part and which will have hte desired ratio to unity. For example, suppose we want an interval which is 1/3 of an octave. Its logarithm will be .1003433, or 1/3 of the log(2), to which corresponds the ratio 126:100 or 63:50, which is approximately 29:23 or 5:4. This last ratio, 5:4, designates the major third, which is considered as the third part of an octave by those with less technical knowledge of music. 

CHAPTER V

ON SUCCESSION OF CONSONANCES

1. In the preceding chapter we have demonstrated sufficiently how several tones should be combined to produce pleasing harmony when sounded together. Our purpose in this chapter is to investigate the nature of two tones or consonances in agreeable succession. To obtain an agreeable succession, it is not sufficient for each of the consonances to please separately, but they should have a certain mutual affection so that the succession itself charms and delights the hearing.

2. By the general rules, treated in Chapter II, for effecting any agreeableness, it is established that a succession of two consonances pleases if there is perceptible order among the individual tones of each consonance. To find out how easily the mind comprehends such a succession, one must express the individual tones of each consonance by the numbers which represent them and consider their least common multiple. A table of degrees of agreeableness will show how much discrimination is required for perceiving the given succession.

3. The successive consonances should be considered as sounding together, and the exponent of this composite consonance will indicate the agreeableness and ease of perception of the succession itself. The exponent is the least common multiple of all the tones which are contained in both consonances, and the agreeableness of the succession is determined from this least common multiple. Thus the exponent of the succession is the least common multiple of all the tones in both consonances.

4. Thus, if the tones which please as a simultaneous group are produced successively, they should also please. There is a difference, however, in the agreeableness by which two consonances, sounding either simultaneously or successively, are perceived. Two consonances, which are very pleasing to the ears when following one another, are somewhat harsher when produced simultaneously. Thus, two tones having the ratio 8:9 are heard with less pleasure when sounded together than when sounded successively. 

5. Just as the simplest trisonant consonance is more composite than the simplest bisonant consonance, the more tones in a consonance, the more composite it will be, even if it is the simplest of its kind. Nonetheless, greater agreeableness will be obtained from multisonant consonances than from a simple tone or from bisonant consonances. The more tones present, the more relationships there are to observe, and the agreeableness is increased. However, if the component tones of consonances are increased too much, the many various stimuli affecting the hearing simultaneously confuse rather than please.

6. In successions of two consonances, the very nature of things requires that the exponents be more composite than those of single consonances. Hence, it does not harm the agreeableness to place consecutively those consonances which would be less pleasing if sounded together. Just as multisonant consonances can have, without loss of agreeableness, greater exponents than some consonances consisting of fewer tones, so also the exponents of successions can be more composite than the exponents of consonances, without any loss of agreeableness.

7. However, it cannot be denied that the simpler the exponent of a succession of two consonances, the easier the perception of the succession itself and of the order contained in it. Previously we discussed the rules concerning ease of perception, and these rules are generally applicable and are subject to no exception. But if we use successions which are too simple, the variety by which music gives so much delight would be utterly destroyed. The consonances would be very simple and similar to each other. Thus, more composite exponents of succession can be used, but if these same exponents were to represent simple consonances they would upset all harmony.

8. In order that two successive consonances may be perceived with agreeableness, both the individual consonances and the succession itself must be pleasing. The agreeableness of the separate consonances is indicated by the exponents, as was shown in the preceding chapter. Likewise, the agreeableness of the succession is indicated by its exponent. More degrees of agreeableness are allotted to the successions than to the consonances themselves, since the exponent of the succession can be more composite.

9. For determining the exponent of a succession of two consonances it is not sufficient to consider each consonance separately, but it is necessary to examine the relationship of the tones which are represented in these consonances by the same numbers. Since the same consonance can exist at any pitch level so long as its constituent tones have the same ratio, it can be expressed in infinite ways. However, in a succession of two consonances, we should give attention not only to the consonances themselves but also to the pitch level of each. This is best done by comparing the bases which correspond to each consonance. If these bases are referred to different tones, the exponent of the succession will not be the least common multiple of the exponents of the consonances, but the ratio of the bases should also be reckoned in the computation.

10. If a given tone is taken as the base, an octave may be represented not only by 1:2 but also by 2:4, 3:6, and, in general, _a:2a_. The nature of this consonance is correctly identified from the exponent 2 and the factor _a_ is disregarded. But if this consonance is joined with others, the number _a_ should be considered. If this consonance is followed by a consonance of tones _2b_ and _3b_, which is the fifth and has an exponent of 6, the exponent of the succession cannot be deduced from just the exponents 2 and 6, but the ratio _a:b_ must be known, since the exponent of the succession is the least common multiple of _a_, _2a_, _2b_, and _3b_.

11. In comparing several simple tones with exponent 1, we should consider the numbers expressing their relationship. So, too, in comparing several consonances, we should consider both the exponents and their relationship. Hence, although the base of a particular consonance may be expressed as unity, in comparing several consonances we should assign the base of each the number which agrees with the ratio of all the tones. From this it is clear that in the comparison of several consonances, each of them should be expressed by two numbers: its exponent and the index, which relates its base to the other bases. 

12. To the exponent we will always add the index enclosed in parentheses in order to distinguish it from the exponent. For example, consider 6(2), where 6 is the exponent of the consonance 1:2:3:6. The index 2 relates it to a consonance which would have a base of 1 if it were considered separately, but in this context its base is 2. Thus the tones of this consonance should be indicated by the numbers 2:4:6:12.

13. We have seen that a particular consonance can be expressed by an infinitude of numbers, provided that they have the same ratio to each other. The exponent of the consonances 2:3, 44:6, 6:9, and so forth, is the same, even if the tones are different. Likewise, the index of a consonance determines which of the infinite groups of numbers will designate the given consonance. This is required for making a comparison of several consonances. It is evident that the individual numbers derived from the exponent must be multiplied by the index. In this way the base of the consonance is made equal to the index and all the tones retain the same relationship to each other.

14. From this it is clear how to find the exponent and index of a consonance consisting of tones expressed by given numbers. The exponent is found by dividing all the numbers by the greatest common divisor and by finding the least common multiple of the result. The index is the greatest common divisor itself. Thus, the index of the consonance 3:6:9:15 is 3 and the exponent is 30, which is the least common multiple of the numbers 1:2:3:5. This consonance is expressed as 30(3).

15. Consider a consonance with an exponent _A_ and index _a_. Let the divisors of _A_ be 1, α, β, γ, δ,... The tones of this consonance will have the ratio 1:α:β:γ:δ:..., and the least common multiple of these numbers is _A_. If the index _a_ is added, the tones of the consonance A(a) should be expressed by the following numbers:
a:αa:βa:γa:δa:...
The least common multiple of these numbers is _Aa_ because of the greatest common divisor _a_. In determining the agreeableness of the consonance itself, the number _a_ is disregarded, and the agreeableness is indicated by the exponent.

16. Let A(a) be followed by B(b). The divisors of the exponent _B_ are 1:η:θ:ι:χ:... Since the agreeableness of the succession depends upon the agreeableness of the composite consonance, the exponent of the succession is the least common multiple of the numbers
a:αa:βa:γa:δa:b:ηb:θb:ιb:χb.
These tones would be considered if both consonances were heard at the same time. Since the least common multiples of the numbers a:αa:βa:γa:δa and of b:ηb:θb:ιb:χb are _Aa_ and _Bb_, respectively, the exponent of the succession will be the least common multiple of the numbers _Aa_ and _Bb_.

17. As we have noted, the agreeableness of a consonance would be judged incorrectly from the least common multiple of the numbers expressing the tones if these numbers have a common divisor, and the same must hold true of a succession of two consonances. Therefore, if the numbers
a:αa:βa:γa:δa:b:ηb:θb:ιb:χb
have a common divisor, each must first be divided by it and replaced by the quotient. This cannot be done if _a_ and _b_ have no common factors. Hence, whenever the indices of the two consonances have a common divisor, the indices must be divided by it before the exponent of the succession is obtained.

18. Now consider the indices _a_ and _b_ of the consonances A(a) and B(b) when these indices have no common factors. The exponent of the succession of these consonances will be the least common multiple of the numbers _Aa_ and _Bb_. To find this, it is necessary to obtain the greatest common divisor, _D_. Either number is divided by _D_ and the quotient is multiplied by the other number. Thus, _ABab/D_ will be the least common multiple of the numbers _Aa_ and _Bb_ and will also be the exponent of the succession of the given consonances. This exponent denotes the agreeableness of the succession.

19. Since _a_ and _b_ are assumed to be numbers with no common factors, the numbers _Aa_ and _Bb_ will have a common factor if _A_ and _B_ or _A_ and _b_ or _B_ and _a_ have factors in common. But the more such divisors are found, the greater will be the greatest common divisor of _Aa_ and _Bb_; and the more composite that the greatest common divisor is, the smaller will be the least common multiple and the more agreeable will be the succession of consonances. Since the exponent of the succession is _ABab/D_, the larger the greatest common divisor, the simpler will be the quotient _ABab/D_ and the degree of agreeableness to which the succession  belongs.

20. Let the numbers _A_, _B_, _a_, and _b_ belong to the degrees of agreeableness _p_, _q_, _r_, and _s_, respectively. Also, let the greatest common divisor _D_ belong to the degree _t_. Then the number _ABab/D_ will belong to the degree _p+q+r+s-t-2_, as may be deduced from what has been said previously.<fn>See Section 25 and 26, Chapter II. _ABab_ belongs to the degree _p+q+r+s-3_. _ABabD_ belongs to _p+q+r+s+t-4_. Then the degree of _ABabD_ exceeds the degree of _ABab_ by t-1, and the degree of _ABab_ exceeds the degree of _ABab_ by t-1. Thus the degree of _ABab/D_ is _p+q+r+s-t-2_</fn> Therefore, the given numbers _A_, _B_, _a_, _b_, and _D_ will yield the degree of agreeableness to which the succession of A(a) and B(b) belongs, that is, _p+q+r+s-t-2_. The smaller this number is, the more agreeable the succession.

21. For example, let the consonance 120(2) consisting of the tones 2:4:6:8:10:12:16 be followed by the consonance 60(3) consisting of the tones 3:6:9:12:15. These consonances belong to the tenth and ninth degrees respectively. The succession should be judged from the least common multiple of the numbers 240 and 180, of which the greatest common divisor is 60, belonging to the ninth degree. Since _A_=120, _a_=2, _B_=60, _b_=3, and _D_=60, then _p_=10, _q_=9, _r_=2, _s_=3, and _t_=9. Thus, _p+q+r+s-t-2_=13. Hence, the exponent of the succession is 13, the degree of agreeableness of the succession.

22. If the exponents of each consonance are given, the indices can be determined so that the succession is the most agreeable. Let _M_ be the least common multiple of the exponents _A_ and _B_. Obviously, the succession's exponent _ABab/D_ is either equal to, or greater than, _M_ itself, since it cannot be less. The succession will be most agreeable if _ABab/D_ is equal to _M_ itself; it will have less agreeableness if _ABab/D_ is equal to _2M_ or _3M_ or _4M_, etc. Therefore, if we set _ABab=nDM_, the more agreeable the succession made by the indices _a_ and _b_, the smaller the number _n_.

23. We will designate a succession of _first order_ as one in which the least common multiple of the numbers _Aa_ and _Bb_ is equal to _M_ itself or to the least common multiple of the numbers _A_ and _B_. A _second order_ succession will have an exponent of 2M. A _third order_ succession will have an exponent of either _3M_ or _4M_, since the numbers 3 and 4 belong to the third degree of agreeableness. In general, the succession whose exponent is _nM_ will have the same order as the degree of agreeableness to which _n_ belongs. Care should be taken not to confuse the order of succession with the degree of agreeableness, for we say that a succession is of first order when it fulfills the given conditions, even if the succession itself belongs to a much higher degree of agreeableness.

24. Thus, it is clear that the succession of consonances _A_ and _B_ would be of first order if both _a_ and _b_ were unity; for the least common multiple of the numbers _A1_ and _B1_ is _M_. However, even if _a_ and _b_ are not equal, the succession of consonances A(a) and B(b) can be of first order. This is happens if _b_ in _Bb_ either is equal to _A_ or consists of only factors of _A_, and if at the same time _a_ in _Aa_ is equal to _B_ or consists of only the factors of _B_. In this case _M_ will be the least common multiple of _Aa_ and _Bb_.

25. Let _d_ be the greatest common divisor of the exponents _A_ and _B_ and _A=dE_, _B=dF_, with _E_ and _F_ having no common factors. Also, let _e_ and _f_ be factors of _E_ and _F_, respectively. Then the succession of the consonances dE(f) and dF(e) will be of first order, for the least common multiple of _dEf_ and _dFe_ is _dEF_, which is the same as that for _A_ and _B_ or _dE_ and _dF_. For example, _A_=15 and _B_=18, then _d_=3, _E_=5, and _F_=6. Therefore, _e_ can be either 1 or 5 and _f_ can be 1, 2, 3, or 6. The succession will be of first order if _A(a)_ is 15(1), 15(2), 15(3), or 15(6), and B(b), the consonance following A(a), is 18(1) and 18(5).

26. From this it is clear what kind of indices must be used in order that the exponent of a succession may be _2M_ or _2dEF_, in which case the succession is of second order. In like manner, indices can be found so that the exponent of the succession is _ndEF_ or so that the succession itself may be of a given order. This can be done in several ways, which would be difficult and unnecessary to enumerate. If the exponents of the consonances are 15 and 18, the succession is of second order if the first consonance is 15(1) or 15(3) and the other is 18(2) or 18(10) or if the first is 15(4) or 15(12) and the other is 18(1) or 18(5).

27. If the exponents of the consonances are equal, or _B=A_, and if _a=b=1_, there will be only one succession of first order: A(1) and A(1). There will be two successions of second order: A(1) to A(2) and A(2) to A(1), with exponent of _2A_ in each case. There will be four successions of third order: A(1) to A(3), A(1) to A(4), and their inverses. There will be six successions of fourth order: A(1) to A(6), A(2) to A(3), A(1) to A(8), and their inverses. Any such succession will be of that order indicated by the degree of agreeableness of the product of their indices.

I. 2A(1):A(1), 2A(1):A(2).
II. 2A(1):A(4), 2A(2):A(1)
III. 2A(1):A(6), 2A(1):A(3):A(1), 2A(3):A(2), 2A(1):A(8), 2A(4):A(1).
IV. 2A(1):A(12), 2A(2):A(3), 2A(3):A(4), 2A(1):A(16), 2A(8):A(1).
V. 2A(1):A(10), 2A(1):A(5), 2A(5):A(1), 2A(5):A(2), 2A(1):A(18), 2A(1):A(9), 2A(9):A(1), 2A(9):A(2), 2A(1):A(24), 2A(3):A(8), 2A(4):A(3), 2A(1):A(32), 2A(16):A(1).

If the exponents of successive consonances are A and 3A, the successions will be the following:

I. 3A(1):A(1), 3A(1):A(3).
II. 3A(1):A(6), 3A(1):A(2), 3A(2):A(1), 3A(2):A(3).
III. 3A(1):A(9), 3A(3):A(1), 3A(1):A(12), 3A(1):A(4), 3A(4):A(1), 3A(4):A(3).
IV. 3A(1):A(18), 3A(3):A(2), 3A(2):A(9), 3A(1):A(24), 3A(1):A(8), 3A(8):A(1), 3A(8):A(3).

If the exponents are A and 4A, the successions will be the following:

I. 4A(1):A(1), 4A(1):A(2), 4A(1):A(4).
II. 4A(1):A(8), 4A(2):A(1).
III. 4A(1):A(12), 4A(1):A(6), 4A(1):A(3), 4A(3):A(1), 4A(3):A(2), 4A(3):A(4), 4A(1):A(16), 4A(4):A(1).
IV. 4A(1):A(24), 4A(2):A(3), 4A(3):A(8), 4A(6):A(1), 4A(1):A(32), 4A(8):A(1).

28. If the exponent of one consonance is twice that of another, or if _B=2A_, these two successions will be of first order: A(1) to 2A(1) and 2A(1) to A(2), for the exponent of these is _2A_, which is the same as for the exponents themselves, _A_ and _2A_. The exponent of successions of the second order is _4A_. Such successions are A(1) to 2A(2), A(4) to 2A(1), and their inverses. Similarly, we can proceed with successions of any order, with _B=3A_ or, in general, _B=nA_. Thus, we can easily find the simpler successions which are useful.

29. If the exponents of consonances are equal to each other, the successions of the first through the sixth orders will be the following, where the orders of the successions are indicated by Roman numerals and the exponents of each consonance by _A_'s:

I. A(1):A(1).
II. A(2):A(1).
III. A(3):A(1), A(4):A(1).
IV. A(6):A(1), A(3):A(2), A(8):A(1).
V. A(5):A(1), A(9):A(1), A(12):A(1), A(4):A(3), A(16):A(1).
VI. A(10):A(1), A(5):A(2), A(18):A(1), A(9):A(2), A(24):A(1), A(8):A(3), A(32):A(1).

If the exponents of the consonances are _2A_ and _A_, the successions through the fifth order will be the following:

If the exponents are _A_ and _6A_, the successions will be the following:

I. 6A(1):A(1), 6A(1):A(2), 6A(1):A(3), 6A(1):A(6).
II. 6A(1):A(12), 6A(1):A(4), 6A(2):A(1), 6A(2):A(3).
III. 6A(1):A(18), 6A(1):A(9), 6A(3):A(1), 6A(3):A(2), 6A(1):A(24), 6A(1):A(8), 6A(4):A(1), 6A(4):A(3).

If the exponents are _2A_ and _3A_, the successions will be the following:

I. 3A(1):2A(1), 3A(2):2A(1), 3A(1):2A(3), 3A(2):2A(3).
II. 3A(1):2A(2), 3A(1):2A(6), 3A(4):2A(1), 3A(4):2A(3).
III. 3A(1):2A(9), 3A(3):2A(1), 3A(6):2A(1), 3A(2):2A(9), 3A(1):2A(12), 3A(1):2A(4), 3A(8):2A(1), 3A(8):2A(3).

If the exponents are _A_ and _8A_, the successions will be the following:

I. 8A(1):A(1), 8A(1):A(2), 8A(1):A(4), 8A(1):A(8).
II. 8A(1):A(16), 8A(2):A(1).
III. 8A(1):A(24), 8A(1):A(12), 8A(1):A(6), 8A(1):A(3), 8A(3):A(1), 8A(3):A(2), 8A(3):A(4), 8A(3):A(8), 8A(1):A(32), 8A(4):A(1).

If the exponents are _A_ and _5A_, the successions will be the following:

I. 5A(1):A(1), 5A(1):A(5)
II. 5A(1):A(10), 5A(1):A(2), 5A(2):A(1), 5A(2):A(5). 

If the exponents are _A_ and _9A_, the successions will be the following:

I. 9A(1):A(1), 9A(1):A(3), 9A(1):A(9). 
II. 9A(1):A(18), 9A(1):A(6), 9A(1):A(2), 9A(2):A(1), 9A(2):A(3), 9A(2):A(9).

If the exponents are _A_ and _12A_, the successions will be the following:

I. 12A(1):A(1), 12A(1):A(2), 12A(1):A(3), 12A(1):A(4), 12A(1):A(6), 12A(1):A(12).
II. 12A(1):A(24), 12A(1):A(8), 12A(2):A(1), 12A(2):A(3).

If the exponents are _3A_ and _4A_, the successions will be the following:

I. 4A(1):3A(1), 4A(1):3A(2), 4A(1):3A(4), 4A(3):3A(1), 4A(3):3A(1), 4A(3):3A(2), 4A(3):3A(4).
II. 4A(1):3A(8), 4A(2):3A(1), 4A(3):3A(8), 4A(6):3A(1).

If the exponents are _A_ and _16A_, the successions will be the following:

I. 16A(1):A(1), 16A(1):A(2), 16A(1):A(4), 16A(1):A(8), 16A(1):A(16).
II. 16A(1):A(32), 16A(2):A(1).

30. From the above it is clear how both the exponent and the order of the succession of two consonances can be determined. Knowledge of these makes it easy to find the degree of agreeableness with which a given succession of consonances will be received by the hearing. Also, a consonance can be chosen to follow a given consonance so that they constitute a succession of given order, either first, second, third, etc. This can be done in many ways, as the preceding rules and table clearly shows.

31. It is also clear that it is possible to produce in several ways successions of two consonances with the same exponent of succession. In order that this may be clearer, let _E_ be the exponent of succession and take _M_ and _N_ as any two divisors whose least common multiple is _E_. Then let each of the divisors be resolved into two factors so that _M=Aa_ and _N=Bb_, where _a_ and _b_ have no common factors. Then, the succession A(a):B(b) may be formed, and its exponent will be _E_.

Chapter VI 

ON SERIES OF CONSONANCES

1. In the two preceding chapters we have discussed at length how to obtain pleasing harmony in single consonances and in successions of two consonances. But this is not at all sufficient for producing an agreeable musical composition. In order that several consonances or successions of consonances may be perceived with pleasure, it is also necessary that the order existing in the complete succession of consonances be perceived by the mind and that this order advance the real goal, agreeableness.

2. Single consonances, agreeable in themselves, can produce no harmony if joined without system. This is also true of several successions, which may indeed be arranged according to prescribed laws but still have a highly unpleasant effect on the ears unless certain rules are observed. In this chapter, then, we will show what laws must be observed in joining together several consonances.

3. That division of music which shows how to join several consonances to each other to constitute agreeable harmony is commonly called _simple composition_. The word "composition" is usually understood to mean the creation of musical work. For composing a simple composition, which is the basis of all other compositions, it is first necessary to know in what exists the agreeableness of several successive consonances or of the whole harmony. Then, from this principle, rules are deduced which must be observed in simple composition.

4. The source of the agreeableness which can exist in a succession of several consonances is the same as that of single consonances and successions of two consonances. Hence, in order to perceive the harmony of several successive consonances, it is necessary to understand the order existing in the individual parts, i.e., in the tones and consonances, singly and collectively.

5. From the examples of individual consonances and of successions of two consonances, it easily follows that we comprehend the harmony of several consonances in succession if we perceive the exponent of all the tones constituting this series of consonances. Thus it is clear that comprehension of the agreeableness of several successive consonances requires a grasp of the exponent of all the tones and of the consonances composed of them.

6. The exponent of all the tones constituting the succession consonances is the least common multiple of the numbers representing the tones. Therefore, in the case of a given series of consonances, the required degree of comprehensive facility can be found from the least common multiple of all the tones in the series, with the help of the given table and rules. From the degree of agreeableness given either by the table or by the rules, it can be determined how agreeable any given series of consonances will be to the hearing.

7. Since the exponent of a series of consonances is the least common multiple of all the numbers representing the various tones which occur, it is clear that this exponent is divisible by the exponents of the individual consonances and of every binary succession. Hence, in order to know the exponent of the whole series of consonances, it is necessary that both the individual consonances and the binary successions be perceived. In this way, consequently, there will be comprehension of the whole connection.

8. Whether it is known in advance or is perceived from several consonances, the exponent of a series of consonances will reveal what kind of tones or consonances can occur. Thus that exponent determines the limits of the composition and also includes all the appropriate tones and excludes the unsuitable ones. This limitation is called the musical mode, which is a particular selection of tones suitable for use in composing a piece of music. Other tones cannot be introduced.

9. Therefore, since a musical mode is determined by the exponent of all the tones which constitute the mode, we will call this exponent the exponent of the mode or modal exponent. Hence, if we have a complete consonance<fn>See Section 21, Chapter IV.</fn> with an exponent equal to that of the mode, this consonance will have all the tones which can be used in this mode. If this exponent is known, one can judge at once whether the mode has been preserved in a given composition or some transgression has been made against the mode by use of tones not contained in the modal exponent.

10. We said that going beyond the mode is a transgression, but that is true only so long as the mode is retained. Indeed, alternation of the mode and transition from one mode to another are permitted and are usually very pleasant, not only within a composition but even within the same part of a composition. The same rules given for a succession of consonances will apply to the change or succession of modes.

11. When the same mode is used in any portion or period of a composition, the exponent of that portion or of two such portions in succession will be determined just as the exponent of any consonance or binary succession was found. Finally, the exponent of a whole composition represents all exponents or all tones used in all parts. 

12. Therefore, in order for a composition to please, there must be perception of the exponents of (1) single consonances, (2) successions of two consonances, (3) single periods, (4) successions of two periods or changes of modes, and (5) all the periods, that is, the whole composition. If one perceives all of these, he understands the composition perfectly and is able to judge it correctly.

13. I do not doubt that such comprehension of a composition seems to be an accomplishment of the greatest difficulty, far surpassing the power of the human intellect because of the highly composite nature of the exponent of the whole composition. But no matter how difficult this comprehension may seem, the intellect is assisted in a wonderful way as the perception is acquired gradually. Just as the exponent of a succession of two consonances is perceived with no difficulty by observing the exponents of the consonances, even if the exponent of the succession is very composite and can hardly recognized in itself, so also, with successive perception of simpler exponents, the comprehension of more composite exponents follows without difficulty.

14. The perception of exponent of a succession of two consonances should result from the order of the succession, not from the exponent itself or its degree of agreeableness. Similarly, the exponent of a mode or of one period is made easier by the perception of the exponents of both consonances and successions. This comprehension of modal exponents leas quite naturally to recognition of exponents of successions of modes. In this way perception of the exponent of the whole composition becomes quite simple. 

15. Therefore, in order that a musical composition may be heard with pleasure, it is necessary that the exponents of the successions of two consonances not be much more composite than the exponents of the consonances themselves; that the modal exponents not greatly exceed the exponents of the successions; and that the exponent of the whole composition be not much more difficult to perceive than the other exponents. The real agreeableness and pleasure which the listener can derive from music lie in that perception and in comprehension progressing from the simpler to the more composite; and this was amply demonstrated in Chapter II in the treatment of the true principles of harmony.

16. From these matters it is clear how a musical work should be prepared in order to please intelligent listeners. At the same time, it is clear that a musical works in which there is encroachment (we shall inquire of what kind) of these rules should displease the hearers. It is easy to see how such imperfect musical works can be accepted by less intelligent hearers, since they do not notice imperfections and encroachments of the rules of harmony but still perceive and appreciate the congruous passages.

17. Since the exponent of several consonances is the exponent of all the tones constituting those consonances, it will be the least common multiple of the numbers representing the individual tones. It can be found easily from the exponents plus indices of the consonances, in a manner similar to that by which we found the exponent of a succession in the preceding chapter. The same rules which were given for two consonances are valid for three or more. The exponent of a series of consonances is merely the least common multiple of the exponents of the individual consonances.

18. Let us consider first several simple tones produced successively, with a mutual relationship expressed by the numbers _a:b:c:d:e_, and let us seek the exponent of this series of numbers. Since a simple tone is a consonance of the first degree and has an exponent of unity, unless it is compared with others, the letters _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, and _e_ will denote the indices of those simple tones, considered as consonances, have with each other. Therefore, these tones, like consonances, should be expressed thus: _1(a):1(b):1(c):1(d):1(e)_.

19. The exponent of this series of simple tones is the same as that of the consonance composed of these tones. The exponent of the consonance _a:b:c:d:e_ is the least common multiple, say, _D_, of the numbers _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_. Hence, considering the successive tones as consonances, the exponent of the series of consonances _1(a):1(b):1(c):1(d):1(e)_ will also be _D_, i.e., the least common multiple of the indices  _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, since all the exponents themselves are 1. From the degree of agreeableness to which _D_ belongs we can judge how pleasing that series of tones will be to the hearing. 

20. Now let _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_, _E_ be the exponents of successive consonances and _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_ be their respective indices which express the relationship of the bases of the consonances, so that this series of consonances may be represented thus: _A(a):B(b):C(c):D(d):E(e)_. Let us also assume that _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_ have no common factors other than unity. If they have a common factor, they should be divided by it before the exponent of the series is sought.

21. The tones of the consonance A(a) are divisors of the exponent _A_, with each divisor multiplied by _a_. Hence, their least common multiple will be _Aa_. Similarly, the least common multiple of _B(b)_, _C(c)_, _D(d)_, and _E(e)_ will be _Bb_, _Cc_, _Dd_, and _Ee_, respectively. Therefore, the least common multiple of all the tones contained in the successive consonances will be the least common multiple of the numbers _Aa_, _Bb_, _Cc_, _Dd_, and _Ee_. This least common multiple will be the desired exponent of the given series of consonances.

22. For example, consider the following consonances:
8:12:16:24:32:38,
8:12:20:24:40:60,
9:12:18:27:36:54,
10:15:20:30:45:60,
9:15:30:36:45:60.
Divide each tone of each consonance by the greatest common divisor and find the least common multiple of the resulting numbers. The greatest common divisor will be the index, and the least common multiple will be the exponent of the consonance. The given consonances may now be expressed thus:
24(4):30(4):36(3):36(5):60(3).
From these the exponent of a series of consonances is found to be 4320, which belongs to degree XVI.

23. This example and the given rules clarify how to find the exponent of any given series of consonances. This exponent enables us to judge the mutual harmony of those consonances. The exponent of each consonance should be multiplied by its index, and the least common multiple of the products thus obtained will be the exponent of the given series of consonances.

24. If two or more series of consonances are conjoined to make a whole piece of music and the exponents, _M_, _N_, _P_, _Q_, etc., have been found by the given rules, we must first ascertain whether or not unity designates the same tone in each exponent. If it does not, the ratio among those tones denoted by unity in the individual series should be indicated by the smallest numbers, say, _m_, _n_, _p_, _q_, etc., which are the indices to the connected with the exponents, so that the relationship of the series of consonances may be expressed thus:
M(m):N(n):P(p):Q(q):....

25. Since such a series of consonances expressed by an exponent is a musical mode, it is clear how the transition from one mode to another and the joining of several modes should be judged. If the successive modes are expressed by the exponents and indices thus: M(m):N(n):P(p):Q(q):..., we can find the exponent which will give us the nature and character of the whole musical work composed of those modes by finding the least common multiple of _Mm_, _Nn_, _Pp_, _Qq_, etc. This will be the exponent of the given composition as a whole. 

26. In order that a correct judgment may be made about a given composition, we must first consider the individual consonances and find their exponents. Secondly, we must consider the successions of two consonances. Thirdly, we should consider the several consonances in one mode. Fourthly, we should examine the succession of two modes or the change from one mode to another. Fifthly, we should investigate the arrangement of all the modes joined together in the composition. We have adequately shown above how each of these steps can be accomplished with the aid of exponents.

27. It remains for us to show in this chapter, as much as can be done in this point, how a series of consonances and then a whole composition should be prepared so that pleasing harmony results. In this matter we shall be occupied in finding the exponents of the individual consonances from a given mode or the exponent of a series of consonances. Since the very great number of exponents which can be used give rise to innumerable series of consonances, the art of music is limitless in scope and can be expanded not only by new works but also by new modes. 

28. Today, when the study of music has been brought to such a degree of perfection, it is certainly astonishing that skilled composers are so busy creating new works, caring nothing about increasing the small number of modes which have been in use for a long time. The reason is that hitherto the truth principles of harmony were unknown, and, because of this lack, the study of music was carried on only be experiment and custom.

29. Since the exponent of a series of consonances is the least common multiple of the products of the exponents and respective indices of the individual consonances, all the products thus obtained will be divisors of the exponent of the series. Hence, in order to find the consonances themselves if the exponent, _M_, of a series of consonances is given, we use as many as we please of M's divisors, which could be designated as _Aa_, _Bb_, _Cc_, _Dd_, etc. Then _A(a):B(b):C(c):D(d)..._ will represent a series of consonances with the given number _M_ as exponent.

30. In finding these divisors we should keep in mind that they exhaust the given exponent _M_ so that they do not have a smaller least common multiple than _M_. This is accomplished if at the beginning we place together some consonances whose exponents exhaust the given number _M_. This will be very useful because the exponent of a whole series of consonances is perceived by first hearing a few consonances. Recognition of this exponent makes easier the judgment of the harmony of the whole series. But more about these things later. 

CHAPTER VII

ON THE CURRENT NAMES OF VARIOUS INTERVALS

1. Having shown in general the rules of harmony appropriate of consonances as well as their combination, we go on to treat more fully the uses of the given rules in the various kinds of music. But before the kinds of music can be properly listed and discussed, the special current names should be explained so that we can use the usual terminology in our discussion. These names were applied a long time ago to several musical intervals. Because of their continued use, it is convenient and necessary to explain them.

2. These names, of which some have been mentioned here and there in the previous chapters, have been given definitions which are not sufficiently natural and are poorly suited for our purpose. The intervals to which particular names are applied are usually described from practice and experience rather than from the nature of the sounds. We will continue to express intervals by their ratios of by their corresponding logarithms, whence a better discrimination of the size of any interval can be made.

3. We have previously shown that the difference of pitch between two tones is an interval, and the greater this difference is, the larger the interval is said to be. Therefore, if the tones are the same there will be no distance between them. The interval of the tones having the ratio of equality, 1:1:, will be zero, and the logarithm of this ratio is also zero; for as we have already decided, we will measure intervals by the logarithms of the ratios between the tones. This vanishing interval of the two equal tones is called a _unison_.

4. In expressing these logarithms of ratios we could use any logarithmic system in which the logarithm of unity is zero. It will be advantageous, however, to use a system in which log(2) is unity since 2 occurs most often in expressing consonances and is very highly regarded in music. By this means the computation is also made much easier. The following table of such logarithms will suffice for our purpose:

[table of log2]

5. After the unison, we should consider the interval having the ratio 2:1, which the Greek musicians called the _diapason_. Its tones sound almost like one, and this interval is considered to comprehend all other intervals. The Latin name for this interval is _octava_ and the reason for this name is linked to the diatonic musical genus which we will discuss later in more detail. The measure of the diapason or octave<fn>In his _Extrait d'une réponse de M. Rameau à M. Euler sur l'identité des octaves ..._ (Paris, 1753), Rameau objected to Euler's classification of the octave as an interval distinct from the unison. Shirlaw says, "It is not difficult to understand how these conclusions of Euler did not suit Rameau. But the latter, in his 'reply' only demonstrated how badly he was equipped, chiefly through lack of the necessary scientific training, for entering the lists against such men as Euler." See Shirlaw, Matthew, _The Theory of Harmony_, pp. 274-275. </fn> is log(2) - log(1) or log(2), which is 1.000000.

6. Since the interval of tones having a ratio of 4:1 is 2.000000, twice as large as the octave, this interval is usually called the _disdiapason_ or double octave. The interval 8:1, since it is 3.000000, three times the size of the octave, is called the triple octave. Similarly, the interval 16:1, with a measure of 4.00000, is called the quadruple octave, and 32:1 is called the quintuple octave, and so on. Since the names of the larger intervals correspond to the number of octaves contained in them, our choice of unity as log(2) is obvious. The characteristic of the logarithm expressing any interval indicates how many octaves are contained in that interval.

7. The Greek and Latin names for the interval 3:2 are _diapente_ and _quinta_, respectively, and the derivation of this name also comes from the diatonic genus. The measure of this interval is log(3)-log(2) - 0.584982. Thus, this interval is smaller than the octave, and the ratio of the measures of the octave and the fifth cannot be expressed by rational numbers. The following ratios<fn>See Section 38, Chapter IV, for the continued fraction from which these ratios were derived.</fn> are approximations to the true ratio:
5:3, 7:4, 12:7, 17:10, 29:17, 41:24, 53:31.
More accurate ratios cannot be given in numbers smaller than the above.

8. Since the measure of the interval 3:1 is 1.584962, which is the sum of the measures of the octave and fifth, this interval is usually called an octave plus a fifth. Similarly, 6:1 represents a double octave plus a fifth, since its measure is 2.584962. Also, 12:1 is called a triple octave plus a fifth, and 24:1 is called a quadruple octave plus a fifth. Thus, if the decimal fraction is .584962, the interval is composed of a fifth and as many octaves as the characteristic indicates.

9. There is not much difference between the fifth and the _diatessaron_ or fourth. The tones of the latter have the ratio 4:3 with a measure of .415038. Obviously, if the fifth and fourth are joined together, they constitute and octave, since the sum of their measure is 1.000000. Similarly, the interval 8:3, with a measure of 1.1415038, is called an octave plus a fourth, and 16:3, with a measure of 2.415038, is called a double octave plus a fourth and so on.

10. The fifth and the fourth, both smaller than the octave, have simple names, an the intervals resulting from adding one or more octaves to each of them have composite names. Thus, all intervals less than an octave are usually called simple intervals, and all greater than an octave are called composite intervals. Therefore, the measures of simple intervals are less than unity, and the characteristic of the logarithms measuring them is 0. The logarithms of composite intervals are greater than unity, or their characteristics are greater than zero. Thus, it is clear that all simple intervals are contained in the octave, and for this reason the octave is also called the diapason.

11. Since the names of composite intervals come from the number of octaves which they contain plus the name of the excess, which is a simple interval, it will be sufficient to enumerate the simple intervals which have been named and adopted by musicians. In order to make this clearer, we will begin with the smallest intervals: the _comma_, _diesis_, and the _diaschisma_, which can scarcely be perceived by the hearing. If they are added to or subtracted from larger intervals, the latter do not seem to be increased or decreased. Even if this makes no difference to duller ears, we cannot reject these intervals in perfect harmony.

12. The comma is an interval having the ratio 81:80, with a measure of log(81) - log(80) = 0.017920. Hence, there are about 56 commas in an octave. The diesis is the interval 128:125 with a measure of 0.034216. The diesis, therefore, is almost twice as larger as the comma, and an octave contains about 29 dieses. The diaschisma, 2048:2025, has a measure of 0.016296. There are about 61 diaschismata in an octave. I is evident that the diaschisma is the difference between the diesis and the comma.

13. These very small intervals do not ordinarily occur in our accustomed music, and successive tones differing so little are not used; yet the differences of some larger intervals are found to be so small that it has been necessary to introduce these smallest intervals for expressing those differences. The smallest intervals which are actually used in music and which are expressed by tones are the major and minor semitones and the major and minor limmata. Since these intervals differ little from one another, they are considered as equal by the less experienced and are all called semitones. 

14. The major semitone<fn>The just diatonic semitone</fn> is the interval 16:15, and its measure is 0.093110. The minor semitone,<fn>The just chromatic semitone</fn> 25:24, differs from the major by 128:125, diesis, and has a measure of 0.058894; and if the measure of the diesis is added to this, the result will be the measure of the major semitone. Therefore, ten major semitones plus two dieses, or seventeen minor semitones, will give approximately one octave.

16. As we have said, these four kinds of intervals are indiscriminately called semitones. They are also called minor seconds, and this designation, as well as that of the octave, fifth, and fourth, has its origin in the diatonic genus. The major sevenths, with the name from the same origin, designate the octave complements of the aforementioned seconds and have the ratios 15:8, 48:25, 50:27, and 256:135. Their measures are 0.906890, 0.941106, 0.888970, and 0.923186, and these are the largest intervals in use less than an octave.

17. Next in size to the semitones are the tones or major seconds. There are three kinds of tones, of which the first, 9:8, is called the major tone and has a measure of 0.169924. Six such tones exceed an octave by more than a comma. The minor tone, 10:9, is one comma less than the major tone, and thus its measure is .152004. A third tone, 256:225, exceeds the major tone by a diaschisma and the minor tone by a diesis. The octave complements of the tones are called minor sevenths.

18. The tone consists of two semitones, in a broad sense, for the major tone is the sum of the major semitone and the minor limma and is also the sum of the minor semitone and the major limma, and the minor tone is the sum of the major and minor semitones. The largest tone, 256:225, is the sum of two major semitones. Similarly, the succeeding intervals arise from the addition of semitones.

19. Intervals called minor thirds arise from increasing tones by a semitone. Strictly speaking, however, the only intervals deserving this name is the one whose tones have the ratio 6:5. Each of the intervals which differ from this ratio by a comma, a diaschisma, or a diesis is considered as a minor third, which is a rather pleasing interval. The octave complement is called the major sixth, 5:3. The respective measures of the minor third and major sixth are 0.236034 and 0.736966.

20. The major third, which exceeds the minor third by a minor semitone, is a pleasing consonance and is expressed by the ratio 5:4. Its measure is 0.321928. Thus, the major third is the sum of the major and minor tones, and its octave complement is called the minor sixth, which consists of tones having the ratio 8:5 and which has a measure of 0.678072. The Greek word for the sixth is _hexachordon_. Thus the major and minor sixths correspond to the major and minor hexachords, respectively.

21. If we add the major semitone, 16:15, to the major third, 5:4, we obtain the interval called the _diatessaron_ or fourth, which is expressed by the ratio 4:3. The octave complement of this interval is the _diapente_ or the fifth, 3:2. These intervals have already been discussed. Finally, we should note that the difference between the fifth and the fourth is the major tone, 9:8, which first supplied the ancients with the idea of a major tone.

22. Since all the other intervals which follow each other in size differ from one another by semitones, musicians have designated an interval which is halfway between the fifth and fourth and which differs from each by a semitone. This interval is called the tritone, since it is the sum of three tones. It is also called augmented fourth, diminished fifth, and false fifth. For each of the four kinds of semitones there is a variety of the the tritone, the first of which, 64:45, consists of the fourth plus the major semitone. The second, 45:32, results from the subtraction of a major semitone from a fifth. The third kind, 25:18, is the sum of the fourth and the minor semitone. The fourth kind, 36:25, results from subtracting a minor semitone from the fifth or from the addition of two minor thirds.

23. We have observed that the names of these intervals are derived from numbers and are called second, third, fourth, fifth, etc., up to the octave. Similar names are given to intervals which are composite or larger than an octave. An octave plus a major or a minor second is called a major or minor ninth. An octave plus a third is called a tenth. An octave plus a fourth is called an eleventh. Note that we add seven to the names of the simple intervals. Thus a twelfth is an octave plus a fifth. A fifteenth is the double octave. These examples are sufficient to clarify names of this kind.

24. To summarize these remarks, we have added a table which gives the following information in succeeding columns: (1) the names of the simple intervals, (2) the ratio of the tones in numbers, (3) the measures of the intervals given by logarithms chosen for our purpose, and (4) the degree of agreeableness for each interval. From the last column it is possible to judge at once how much more some intervals will please the hearing than others.

[table here]

Therefore, in the matter of agreeableness, the intervals progress thus: octave, fifth, fourth, major third and major sixth, major tone, minor third and minor sixth, both minor sevenths, minor tone and the major sevenths which differs from the octave by a major semitone, semitone, and the other major sevenths.<fn>The tritone would come next in this hierarchy of intervals, which has a modern counterpart in Hindemith's Series 2. He establishes the following harmonic value-order of intervals: octave, fifth, fourth, major third, minor sixth, minor third, major sixth, major second, minor seventh, minor second, major seventh. The tritone is placed outside the classification, whereas Euler assigns it a definite value. Like Euler, however, Hindemith maintains that there is no point at which consonance ceases and dissonance begins. See Hindemith, Paul, _The Craft of Musical Composition_, Book I, _passim_.</fn>


CHAPTER VIII

ON MUSICAL GENERA

1. Thus far we have set forth the nature of tones and the rules for making harmony from these tones and have avoided a discussion of the special rules of musical composition. Before those rules can be accommodated to actual practice, musical instruments and their tuning should be considered. Since the tones used in producing music are offered to the ear by means of human voice or instruments, then, before anything else, the voice and the instruments must be adapted for the production of all tones required for rendering a musical work.

2. Since the exponent of a musical work contains all the necessary tones, it should indicate the number and nature of the tones producible by the musical instruments. Thus, construction of the musical instruments depends on the exponent of the musical work which is to be presented to the hearing by mans of those instruments. Thus, if we wish to perform musical works of various exponents, we may have to have musical instruments which are adapted to those exponents.

3. In producing the tones of a composition with a given exponent, the instruments should be adapted so that they can produce all the tones which that exponent represents, unless perhaps some tones would lie beyond the range of hearing. Such tones would be superfluous and could safely be disregarded. The tones which the given exponent represents are obtained from its divisors. Therefore, the instruments should be constructed so that their compass includes all the perceptible tones expressed by the divisors of that exponent. On the other hand, it is clear what kinds of musical works are suited to a given musical instrument.

4. The tones of a given instrument are best indicated by the exponent which is the least common multiple of all the tones of that instruments. The exponent of an instrument thus makes it clear for what kind of musical works it is adapted. It would not be suitable for musical works whose exponent is not a divisor of the instrument's exponent. The instrument must be capable of all tones which arise from the divisors of its exponent. If it lacks any of these tones, the instrument is imperfect and unsuitable for use.

5. For correctly constructing a musical instrument, a suitable exponent is chosen which contains the exponents of all the musical works to be played by the instrument. Hence, all the divisors of this exponent should be investigated, and, except for those beyond the range of hearing, the tones expressed by these divisors should be represented in the instrument. Besides these tones, others may properly be added for uniformity so that the tones in each octave may be equal in number. This procedure is in general usage and makes instruments more perfect so that they are suitable for producing more musical works.

6. Thus, any divisor of the assumed exponent represents a tone of the instrument and also represents its double, quadruple, octuple, etc., or its half, fourth, eighth, etc. In this way it happens that all intervals called diapason have an equal number of tones and are divided in the same way. Also we have the advantage that, if one octave is correctly tuned, the remaining octaves, higher and lower, may be easily tuned because the tones contained in one octave are reproduced one or more octaves higher or lower.

7. Suppose the exponents of the instrument is _A_ and its divisors are 1, _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, etc. The instrument should be able to produce the tones indicated by these divisors and also the tones 2, _2a_, _2b_, _2c_, _2d_, etc., 4, _4a_, _4b_, _4c_, etc., 1/2, _1/2a_, _1/2b_, _1/2c_, etc., and, 1/4, _1/4a_, _1/4b_, _1/4c_, etc. If we eliminate the fractions by multiplication, all the tones of the instrument can be expressed by 2ⁿ,  _2ⁿa_, _2ⁿb_, _2ⁿc_, _2ⁿd_, ... _2ⁿA_, where _n_ is any whole numbers. The exponent of an instrument built in this manner will no longer be _A_, but 2ᵐA, with _m_ denoting an indefinite number either small or large, so long as the tones are perceptible. 

8. An instrument thus constructed is not only suitable for producing musical works with exponents contained in _A_ but is also suitable for producing works with exponents contained in 2ᵐA. From this it is clear that that an instrument with tones equally distributed in all octaves attains greater perfection and is accommodated to more musical works. This also has the advantage for beginners that by recognizing the tones in one octave they also easily recognize tones of the remaining octaves.

9. in the future we will use the form 2ᵐA for the exponents of musical works, and we will investigate the number and nature of the tones which should be contained in any octave. We will use only odd numbers for _A_, since the factor 2 is already presenting in 2ᵐ. Any exponent 2ᵐA will give a particular division of the octave, both as to the number of tones and as to the intervals formed from these tones. Musicians usually call such a division of the octave a musical genus. The diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic genera have been known for a long time.

10. Suppose we want to find the division of an octave from a given exponent 2ᵐA. If the lowest tone is _E_, the highest will be _2E_, and thus the remaining tones will be contained between the limits _E_ and _2E_. Therefore, the individual divisors must be multiplied by binary powers, to make them larger than _E_ but less than _2E_. This will give all the tones contained in the octave. Thus, it is clear that there should be as many tones in an octave as _A_ has divisors, since there is a tone in each octave corresponding to each divisor in _A_.

11. If the instrument exponent, or the exponent of the musical genus, as we will call it henceforth, is 2ᵐ(a^p), where _a_ is a prime number, then one octave will have _p+1_ tones since _a^p_ has that number of divisors. But if the exponent is _2ᵐ(a^p)(b^q)_, the number of tones in the octave will be (p+1)(q+1) or _pq+p+q+1_, for this is the number of divisors of _(a^p)(b^q)_ if _a_ and _b_ are distinct prime numbers. Similarly, the exponent _2ᵐ(a^p)(b^q)(c^r)_ will give _(p+1)(q+1)(r+1)_ tones contained within the interval of one octave. Therefore, the generic exponent allows us to decide forthwith how many tones may be contained in one octave.

12. The divisors of _A_ indicate the nature of the tones contained in each octave. Each divisor should be multiplied by such binary powers that the ratio of the largest to the smallest is less than 2:1. This is more conveniently done by adding logarithms. Using our system in which log(2)=1, it will be clear at once what binary power each divisor must be multiplied by, so that the logarithms of all the tones do not differ from each other by more than unity.

13. We will survey the usable musical genera, tried and untried, from the simplest to the most composite, and we will indicate to what musical works each is best suited. Certainly, the simplest musical genus is 2ᵐ, which results when A=1. Hence, the only tone in the octave is 1. The next tone, 2, is an octave higher. Thus, all the tones in a musical instrument would be 1:2:4:8:16, since instruments rarely have a compass of more than four octaves. Because of its great simplicity, this genus is unsuitable for producing any harmony.

14. If _A=3_, with divisors 1 and 3, the exponent _2ᵐA_ will give the next musical genus. Here the tones constituting the octave will be 2:3:4. Thus, in this genus the octave is divided into two parts: the fifth and the fourth. By making 3 the lowest tone, the form of this octave can be represented by 3:4:6, where the lower interval is the fourth and the upper is the fifth. All tones of instruments built according to the exponent 2ᵐ·3 will be 2:3:4:6:8:12:16:24:32. This genus is also too simple for us.

15. Musicians have not gone beyond 5 in forming consonances and have used only consonances whose exponents have no prime factors other than 2, 3, or 5. Therefore, initially, I will use in place of _A_ no numbers other than 3, 5, and their powers. After we have discussed the musical genera which thus arise, we will also try to introduce 7. This may lead to new genera and to new and unusual musical works.

16. The third genus of music is 2ᵐ·5, in which the tones in one octave are 4:5:8, where the lower interval is a major third and the upper is a minor sixth. This genus is not usable, not only because of its simplicity, but also because it contains the number 5 and omits 3, and, lacking the simple consonances due to 3, it contains more composite consonances. It would be unsuitable to use the larger prime numbers in consonances and to neglect the smaller, because in this way the harmony would become unnecessarily intricate and less pleasing.

17. In these last two genera there is a single factor of either 3 or 5. Now let us consider exponents with either or both of these factors repeated. The fourth genus has an exponent of 2ᵐ·3², in which the divisors of _A_ or 3² are 1:3:9. An octave contains the tones 8:9:12:16 and consists of three intervals: a major tone and two fourths. It has been said that this is the first genus to have been used.<fn>In his _De institutione musica_ Boethius, quoting Nicomachus, says that the most ancient method of tuning lyre was c-f-g-c'. See Shirlaw, Matthew, _The Theory of Harmony_, p. 470, and Redfield, John, _Music: A Science and an Art_, p. 83</fn> Its originator, Mercury, was the first music maker of Greece. He represented each of the four tones by strings, and thus the instrument is called _tetrachordon_. Later musicians, showing their respect for Mercury, have divided their more composite general into tetrachords, named for the instrument.

18. This original musical genus is in extraordinary agreement with the laws of harmony, and for this reason it aroused the highest admiration in its hearers, to whom harmony was unknown. In this genus the intervals pleasing to the ear were the fifth, fourth, major tone, and octave. And consonance called the third remained unknown until the time of Ptolemy, who first introduced it into music. 

19. The fifth genus has an exponent of 2ᵐ·3·5. Since the divisors of 3·5 are 1, 3, 5, and 15, this genus has in one octave the tones 8:10:12:15:16. The intervals are the major and minor third, major and minor sixth, fifth, fourth, major semitone, and major seventh. It is not certain that this genus has ever been in use, even though it has more possibilities for variety than the preceding genus of Mercury. Undoubtedly, the reason for this is that the number 5 produced major and minor thirds which were ignored up to the time of Ptolemy, who introduced a more composite genus.

20. The sixth genus has an exponent of 2ᵐ·5². The divisors of 5² are 1, 5, and 25, and the tones in one octave are 16:20:25:32. Thus the octave is divided into three intervals. The first two are major thirds and the last consists of a major third plus a diesis. It is not surprising that this genus has never been used, since thirds were unknown in ancient times and sine this genus has some consonances without much agreeableness. It should be added that it lacks two of the most agreeable consonances, the fifth and the fourth.

21. The seventh genus has an exponent of 2ᵐ·3². The divisors of 3² are 1, 3, 9 and 27, and the octave division is 16:18:24:27:32, which has not been accepted in practice.

The eighth genus has an exponent of 2ᵐ·3²·5. The divisors of 3²·5 are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45. The octave division is 32:36:40:45:48:60:64. This genus has much agreeableness and would deserve to be used, even if it were not contained in any accepted genera. 

The ninth genus has the exponent 2ᵐ·3·5², and the octave is divided in the ratio 64:75:80:96:100:120:128.

The tenth genus has the exponent 2ᵐ·5³, and the octave is divided in the ratio 64:80:100:125:128.

22. The eleventh genus has the exponent 2ᵐ·3⁴ and the octave is divided in the ratio 64:72:81:96:108:128. It should be noted that in the tenth and eleventh genera there are intervals and consonances which are not present in the prevailing genus of the present day. Hence, the current genus, the diatonic-chromatic, does not contain these last two genera, but it does comprehend in itself all of the preceding genera and can be used for any musical works for which they are adapted. 

23. The twelfth genus has an exponent of 2ᵐ·3³·5 and its octave is divided in the ratio
128:135:144:160:180:192:216:240:256.
This genus closely resembles the diatonic genus of the ancients, although theirs had only seven tones. If the tone represented by 135 is omitted, the twelfth genus is in agreement with Ptolemy's genus diatonic syntonon<fn>The agreement is perfect. See Barbour, J. M., _Tuning and Temperament_, p. 20.</fn> in which the octave is divided into two tetrachords, each of which spans a fourth and is divided into three intervals which are, from lowest to highest, a major semitone, a major tone, and a minor tone.

24. If the tone 135 is omitted, our twelfth genus has this particular division, for, by beginning with the tone represented by 120, the octave will have the following form:
120:128:144:160 | 180:192:216:240.
Each of the two parts is a fourth divided so that the lowest intervals, 120:128 and 180:192, are major semitones; the middle intervals, 128:144 and 192:216, are major tones; and the highest, 144:160 and 216:240, are minor tones. Ptolemy's diatonic genus had a high degree of agreeableness. This is fully evidenced by experience, since this genus is still in use while others of the ancients' genera, having little or no agreeableness, are neglected.

25. Since this diatonic genus of the ancients lacks the tone 135, which belongs in the octave as much as the other tones, it should not at all be considered perfect; yet, since there is so much agreement between it and our twelfth genus, we will call the latter the corrected diatonic. From this it is clear that the ancient musicians adhered so rigidly to the plan of Mercury that they divided their musical instruments into tetrachords and the tetrachords into three parts. Such an arrangement in this genus is in accord with the principles of harmony but has been the cause of unpleasant results in the others.

26. In addition to Ptolemy's diatonic syntonon, several species of the diatonic genus were used by the ancients. The intervals of the individual tetrachords had the following ratios:
	Pythagoras' Diatonic 			243:256, 8:9, 8:9
	Soft Diatonic 					20:21, 9:10, 7:8
	Diatonic Toniaion				27:28, 7:8, 8:9
	Equal Diatonic 					11:12, 10:11, 9:10
In all of these,<fn>See _ibid_, pp.19-21. Pythagoras' diatonic is the same as Eratosthenes' diatonic. The equal diatonic corresponds to Ptolemy's diatonic hemiolon.</fn> the arrangement is such that the first interval is almost a semitone and the other two are almost tones, and the three together span a fourth. It is easy to see how imperfect and harsh these genera are, and it is no wonder that they are all extinct.

27. Today musical instruments are divided into octaves, all of which are divided equally, but the ancients preferred to divide their instruments into fourths and to divide the fourths equally into three intervals. In this matter they adhered to Mercury's tetrachord rather than to harmony itself. The Pythagorean musicians, particularly, carried this out with arbitrary numbers and without regard for harmony. This is quite clear from the given examples. They did music no little harm with these numbers and deserved the censure they received from Aristoxenus and his followers.

28. Ptolemy's diatonic syntonon, which fortunately arose from this wrong method of treating music, is deservedly still in use and can be observed in harpsichords, clavichords and other keyboard instruments which have shorter and longer keys for producing tones of the diatonic syntonon genus. These keys are usually designated by letters, and it is convenient to denote the tones themselves by the same letters. Thus, the tone with the number 192 is called _C_. Others are _216D_, _240E_, _256F_, _288G_, _320A_, _360B_, and _384c_. 

29. Tones an octave higher, expressed by numbers twice as larger, are indicated by the same letters, not capitalized, and these small letters, with one or more lines, indicate the tones in higher octaves. Thus, we have _320A_, _640a_, _1280a̅_, _2560a̅̅_, _5120a̅_, etc. In like manner, for tones with succeeding numbers, there are corresponding small or capital letters. All tones expressed by the formula 2ⁿ·3 are called _C_; tones expressed by 2ⁿ·3³, _D_; 2ⁿ·3·5, _E_; 2ⁿ, F; 2ⁿ·3², _G_; 2ⁿ·5, _A_; and 2ⁿ·3²·5, _B_. 2ⁿ·3³·5, the tone omitted in the current diatonic genus, is called _F♯_, which exceeds _F_ by a semitone. 

30. The thirteenth genus has an exponent of 2ᵐ·3²·5², and its octave of nine tones is divided in the ratio 128:144:150:160:180:192:200:225:240:256. The ancients seem to have pointed toward this genus with their chromatic genus, even if they may have recognized no harmony in it. The tetrachord in the chromatic genus consisted of two consecutive semitones followed by a minor third or the interval resulting from the subtraction of two semitones from a fourth In our genus there are two successions of two semitones. If some tones are omitted, these successions are followed by minor thirds. It is fitting that we call our thirteenth genus the corrected chromatic after this highly defective chromatic genus of the ancients.

31. The ancients had three principal species of the chromatic genus.<fn>See _ibid_, pp. 17-18.</fn> Each of the two identical tetrachords of each species was divided into three intervals as follows:
	Old Chromatic 			243:256, 67:76, 4864:5427;
	Soft Chromatic 			27:28, 14:15, 5:6;
	Chromatic Syntonon 		21:22, 11:12, 6:7.
Anyone can easily see now much these species of the chromatic genus disagree with the true principles of harmony. They might have been able to use our chromatic genus by omitting tones 225 and 150 and arranging it in two tetrachords thus: 120:128, 144:160 | 180:192, 200:240.
The division of the first tetrachord is the diatonic syntonon. The division of the second is the true chromatic.

32. The fourteenth genus has an exponent of 2ᵐ·3·5³, and the octave is divided in the ratio 256:300:320:375:384:400:500:512. This genus is called the corrected enharmonic since it agrees in the measure with the enharmonic genus of the ancients. They bequeathed the following tetrachord divisions<fn>See _ibid_, p.16. The old enharmonic corresponds closely to Aristoxenus' enharmonic. The Ptolemaic division corresponds to Eratosthenes' enharmonic.</fn> of this genus:
	Old Enharmonic 			125:128, 243:250, 64:81;
	Ptolemaic Enharmonic 	45:46, 23:24, 4:5.
Neither of these is in accord with harmony. If the ancients had replaced this enharmonic genus with the arrangement 
240:250:256:320 | 375:382:400:480,
which omits the tone 300, they would have had some agreeableness; but, with the omission, this genus is to be considered imperfect. 

33. The fifteenth genus has an exponent of 2ᵐ·5⁴, and the octave is divided in the ratio
512:625:640:800:1000:1024.
This genus is of no use because of its harsher intervals and lack of the pleasing consonances contributed by the number 3.

The sixteenth genus has an exponent of 2ᵐ·3⁵, and the octave is divided in the ratio
128:144:162:192:216:243:256.
Because of the lack of consonances arising from 5, this genus has insufficient variety.

The seventeenth genus, which has an exponent of 2ᵐ·3⁴·5, seems to be least incongruous since it may be usable. The octave is divided in the ratio
256:270:288:320:324:360:384:405:432:480:512.
The only criticism against this genus might be its inclusion of commas, which can scarcely be distinguished by the hearing.

34. The eighteenth genus, which has an exponent of 2ᵐ·3³·5², should follow at this point, but since it is the diatonic-chromatic genus itself, currently in use among all musicians, it is worthy of treatment in a special chapter. For convenient reference to the other genera which have been discussed, I have added the following table, which gives the exponents of each genus, the tones in any octave, and the intervals between adjacent tones. I have also included the usual pitch names and have indicated other pitches not commonly known with an asterisk added to the nearest letter.

CHAPTER IX

ON THE DIATONIC-CHROMATIC GENUS

1. The reason for designating our eighteenth genus a the diatonic-chromatic genus is clear from the exponent 2ᵐ·3³·5², since it is the least common multiple of 2ᵐ·3³·5 and 2ᵐ·3²·5², the exponents of the diatonic and chromatic genera, respectively; and thus it fuses these two genera. From this one would surmise that this genus is in agreement with the genus now used by musicians, since they, too, combined the chromatic and diatonic genera of the ancients.

2. First, we will investigate the tones which should be in each octave of our genus. Therefore, we will take all the divisors of 3³·5². These are 1, 3, 5, 3², 3·5, 5², 3³, 3²·5, 3·5², 3³·5, 3²·5², 3³·5² or 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 25, 27, 45, 75, 135, 225, 675. Since the largest of these is 675, the others must be multiplied by powers of 2 so that all will be contained within the ratio 1:2, that is, within an octave. Arranging these numbers in order of size, we have the following tones for one octave:
512:540:576:600:640:675:720:768:800:864:900:960:1024.

3. Hence, one octave  of our genus contains twelve tones, and this agrees with the number of tones in the customary diatonic-chromatic genus. The intervals will show clearly whether the tones in each genus are the same. In our genus the intervals between adjacent tones progress in this order:
	512								720
		Minor limma 					Major semitone
	540								768
		Major semitone 					Minor semitone
	576								800
		Minor semitone 					Major limma
	600								640
		Major semitone 					Minor semitone
	640								900
		Minor limma 					Major semitone
	675								960
		Major semitone 					Major semitone
	720								1024
Let us see how these intervals compare with the usual division of the octave.

4. Although musicians even now disagree about the division of the octave and many different modes are used, I have found in the writings of musicians one division which seems to be the most highly approved. If we designate the first tone as _F_, the intervals progress thus:
	F								B
		Minor limma 					Major semitone
	F♯								c
		Major semitone 					Minor semitone
	G								c♯ 
		Minor semitone 					Major limma
	G♯								d
		Major semitone 					Minor semitone
	A								d♯ 
		Minor limma 					Major semitone
	B♭								e
		Minor semitone 					Major semitone
	B 								f

These intervals are taken from Mattheson's _Die General-Bass Schule_.<fn>_Gross Generalbass-Schule_, 1731.</fn>

5. This system of dividing the octave seems to be quite new since musician were using another plan for many years. However, since they finally arrived at the given plan, there can be little doubt that they discovered from experience that it is more suited for producing harmony. Since this plan differs so little from the true harmonic genus (only two intervals and one pitch, B♭, differ), the truth of our principles, already sufficiently demonstrated elsewhere, is extraordinarily confirmed by the close agreement of our theory with long experience.

6. The usual method of dividing the octave has been carried to such perfection by experience alone that, in order to make it most perfect, the only necessary correction is to lower the tone B♭ by a diesis, which is the difference between a major and a minor limma. With this correction it will become the most perfect genus, the genus best suited for producing harmony. This genus has as many tones as harmony requires, no more and no less, and all the tones will have among themselves the relationship determined from the laws of harmony. 

7. The tones and their intervals of the diatonic-harmonic genus now in use, but corrected by theory, will have the relationship shown in the following table. According to musicians' usual custom, this table begins with the tone _C_ and progresses to _c_. We have indicated the tones by numbers both resolved and unresolved into factors. This makes it easier to examine the mutual relationship of the tones and the intervals. 

[table p 189]

This table is a continuation of the listing of the preceding chapter.

8. The ratio between any two tones can be found from this table. However, in order to show these ratios more clearly, it seems proper to add the following table which shows all possible simple intervals.

[table p. 190]

[tables pp. 191-196]

8. <fn>The number 8 is repeated in the original edition.</fn> All intervals in this genus either are the consonances with the usual names or differ from these consonances by intervals so small as to be imperceptible to duller ears. Since musicians stoutly maintain that no interval may differ from the named intervals by more than one of the smaller intervals, i.e., comma, diesis, or diaschisma, the musicians will have to recognize in practice that our correction has considerable justification. If the tone B♭ is made a diesis higher, as the musicians wish, then the interval C♯:B♭ would be a major sixth plus a comma and a diesis. These last two intervals are indeed small, but taken together they make almost a minor semitone, so that the intervals C♯:B♭ in the accustomed genus would be accepted as a minor seventh rather than a major sixth. Similarly, B♭:c♯ would be a minor third diminished by a comma and a diesis and would be more like a whole tone than a third.

9. From the preceding table we have prepared the following one, in which groups of equal intervals have been placed in order.

[tables pp. 197-200.]

10. From this table we can see at once the intervals between any two tones within an octave. Also, we can see the great difference between intervals of the same name, intervals which are generally considered equal by those without much training in music. The table shows that there are four species of semitones, three species of tones, three species of minor thirds, etc. There is only one species of octave, and it is expressed by the perfect ratio 1:2. Because of its perfection this interval can hardly be permitted to differ from 1:2 without considerable annoyance to the ear. The more perfection and ease of comprehension an interval has, the more perceptible the slightest errors becomes. However, in the case of the less perfect intervals, a small variation has less effect on the ear.

11. With the aid of a monochord, musical instruments can easily tuned to this diatonic-chromatic genus. Of course, the monochord should be divided in the same ratios which should exist among the tones themselves. The rules for this operation were treated in the first chapter. Anyone wishing to tune instruments by ear alone must be able to distinguish the octave interval and to form it by hearing alone. Then, by loosening or stretching the strings, he must be able to produce exactly the fifth, 2:3, and major third.

12. Anyone having such aural acuity can tune an instrument in the following manner. He may first establish the tone _F_, according to the circumstances, and from it he will have all the tones designated with this same letter. Then he obtains _c_, a fifth above, and _A_, a major third below, and he will then have all the remaining tones designated with those letters. He next obtains _G_, a fifth above _C_, and _E_, a major third above. _E_ is a fifth above _A_, from which he obtains _c♯_, a major third above. Then, similarly, he obtains _d_ and _B_ from _G_, _G♯_ from _E_, _C♯_ from _G♯_. From _B_ he obtains _f♯_ and _d♯_. _G♯_ may also be used to obtain _d♯_. Finally, _B♭_ may be obtained as the fifth of _D♯_. In this way, by taking all octaves, the whole instrument will be correctly tuned. 

13. This whole tuning process may be observed more distinctly in the following figure

[figure p 202]

Since the tones _E_, _B_, _G♯_, _F♯_, _D♯_, and _B♭_ may be determined in two ways, i.e., by fifths and thirds, we have a valuable aid in tuning which will enable us to perceive and correct at once any error which may have been committed.

14. Although it was chiefly by experience that the music of today reached this perfect musical genus, with which much excellent music is associated, yet much of this attainment must be attributed to chance. While musicians understood that both tones and semitones were in diatonic genus, they thought that a more perfect genus could be constructed if they divided each tone into two parts and placed new tones within each interval a tone apart, thus obtaining adjacent tones differing by a semitone, at least in the usual broad sense.

15. In making this new division of the octave, the musicians acted not only according to their whims but also according to the principles of harmony, for they decided to interpolate tones which constituted a very excellent musical genus. This was a fruitful invention, but musicians should consider it a product of chance rather than of knowledge of true harmony, since the true diatonic-chromatic genus is also arranged so that it has twelve tones differing by a semitone.

16. This is more apparent from the fact that many musicians have believed that true harmony consisted in equality of intervals rather than in their simplicity. Therefore, in order to satisfy themselves rather than harmony, they did not hesitate to divide the octave into twelve equal parts and to designate the usual twelve tones according to this division. They were strengthened in this purpose by the fact that all intervals are made equal, thus permitting modulation and transposition without alteration. They were not wrong in this purpose but they failed to observe that in this way harmony is taken away from every mode. 

17. In order that this may be made clearer, we show in the following table the individual tones of our diatonic-chromatic genus and of this equal genus, all expressed by logarithms. The differences are also shown. We will take log(_F_) as zero.

[table p 204]

It is clear that in some cases the difference between the same tones of each genus exceeds a comma, and this is sufficient to cause no little disturbance to harmony. Fifths and fourths differ little from the genuine, scarcely a tenth of a diaschisma, but major and minor thirds differ much more, and harmony is composed of these just as much as of fifths and fourths. Finally, since it has no intervals expressible by rational fractions except the octave, this genus must be considered contrary to harmony, even if duller ears scarcely perceive any discrepancy.

18. Others, retaining intact the tones of the diatonic genus, did not hesitate to define the remaining chromatic tones by their own authority, without regard to harmony. Such a musical genus appeared not so long ago in England. In it both the major and minor tones are divided into two almost equal parts, of which the lower is greater than the upper, and each is defined by a super-particular ratio. This seems to follow along with Pythagoras who decided that only superparticular ratios should be admitted for producing harmony. Therefore, between tones differing by a major second he inserted a tone having a ratio of 17:16 to the one below and 17:18 to the one above. How little this division agrees with harmony is quite clear from the foregoing. 

19. We have discussed the eighteenth genus, called the diatonic-chromatic, in which, as it is used today, all modulations can be accomplished. In comparison with others, this genus has the remarkable property that all its intervals seem almost equal to the hearing. Thus any melody can be conveniently sung higher or lower by a semitone, a tone, or any interval. This cannot be done with another genus in which there is greater inequality of intervals. Before we apply general rules of composition to this genus, we will consider other genera, continuing the succession that we have begun.


CHAPTER X

ON SOME MORE COMPOSITE MUSICAL GENERA 

1. Although we have discussed the eighteen initial genera which cover both modern and ancient music, it will not be incongruous to investigate several more composite general, which either have a close relationship with those already treated or might be used suitably for greater perfection of music. In surveying the following genera, we will not take them in order as we have done nor will we go into great detail, since this would be an unending and useless task, but we will discus only those things which seem appropriate to our purpose. 

2. Let us consider the genus which has the exponent 2ᵐ·3²·5³ and which can be appropriately be called the chromatic-enharmonic genus, since the exponent is composed of the exponents of the chromatic and enharmonic genera and is the least common multiple of their exponents. There are twelve tones in the octave of this genus just as in the diatonic-chromatic genus. These twelve tones arise from the twelve divisors of 3²·5³, which are the following:
2¹⁰ : 3²·5³ : 2⁷·3² : 2⁴·3·5² : 2⁸·5 : 2⁵·3²·5 : 2²·3·5³ :
1024: 1125  : 1152  : 1200    : 1280 : 1440    : 1500    :
2⁹·3: 2⁶·5² : 2³·3²·5² : 2⁷·3·5 : 2⁴·5³ : 2¹¹.
1536: 1600  : 1800     : 1920   : 2000  : 2048.

3. The following table shows the succession of tones of this genus and the sizes of the intervals:

[table p 208]

4. In this genus the intervals between successive tones are not all uniform. There are major seconds, semitones, and dieses. As a result, a melody composed in this genus can be transposed to no other pitch level. Hence, the diatonic-chromatic genus is to be preferred. In that genus all the intervals appear to be the same. It is understood that this equality was produced by chance and is not absolutely necessary for producing harmony, as many musicians have believed.

5. Three tones in this genus are not found in the diatonic-chromatic. They are designated as _F*_, _G*_, and _c*_, since they are close to the tones _F_, _G_, and _c_ of the diatonic-chromatic genus. In fact, they differ only by a diesis. Since such a small difference can scarcely be detected by the ear, musical works belonging to the genus 2ᵐ·3²·5³ can be placed quite acceptably by instruments tuned to the usual diatonic-chromatic-genus. This means that _F_, _G_, and _c_ would be used in place of _F*_, _G*_, and _c*_, but the deviations would be almost imperceptible to the sense of hearing. 

6. In the matter of transposition, the diatonic-chromatic genus is agreeably suited to musical works with exponent 2ᵐ·3²·5³. If an interval were originally a minor semitone, musicians more often use a major semitone or a major limma, which differs from the minor semitone by more than a diesis. Besides, even if the instruments are considered suited for the diatonic-chromatic genus, unless they are tuned exactly (hardly possibly), they will not convey greater agreeableness than the usual instruments. 

7. The diatonic-chromatic genus has a wider application than its exponent, 2ᵐ·3³·5², indicates, since it can be used suitably for musical works belonging to the genus 2ᵐ·3²·5³. This is evidence of the superiority of the customary genus. Its use can be extended to even more composite genera, which are so arranged that the tones which differ from those of the diatonic-chromatic genus are so close that the latter may be substituted satisfactorily. We will discuss more fully these genera which can be satisfied by the diatonic chromatic genus.

8. Let us combine the exponents of the three ancient genera into one, so that we have a diatonic-enharmonic genus with an exponent of 2ᵐ·3³·5³. Thus, this genus contains the diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic genera with our corrections. One octave of this genus has sixteen tones, of which twelve belong to the diatonic-chromatic genus and four are new ones differing so slightly from tones of the diatonic-chromatic genus that they maybe obviously be omitted with no perceptible damage to the harmony, as we have noted in the case of the preceding genus. The sixteen tones of one octave are shown in the table on the next page. In place of the foreign tones _D*_, _F*_, _G*_, and _c*_, which differ from the principal tones _D_, _F_, _G_, and _c_ only by a diesis, the latter can be used quite safely.

9. The diesis is the largest of the small intervals, and some may feel that this difference is too large to permit the substitution of the principal tones. Then surely he will permit a difference of a comma. The new tones will differ from the principal ones by a comma at the most in genera whose exponents can be expressed as 2ᵐ·3ⁿ·5², where _n_ is larger than _3_. The following table shows the octaves of all such genera with _n_ less than 8.

[table p 212]

[cont. table p 213]

This genus adds twelve new tones to those of the diatonic-chromatic genus. These twelve tones differ from those of the latter by commas or diaschismata. Since these differences are almost imperceptible, these new tones can be omitted with safety, and the usual tones can be used instead. Thus the diatonic-chromatic genus is effectively equal to the genus 2ᵐ·3⁷·5² and should be considered its equivalent. 

10. Thus the diatonic-chromatic genus with an exponent of only 2ᵐ·3³·5², can be used quite agreeably for compositions with much more composite exponents contained in 2ᵐ·3⁷·5². Although the octaves for such compositions may contain up to  twice as many tones, according to the exponent, yet, because of such small differences, any variation in the harmony is almost imperceptible, whether or not the complete genus is used. Similarly, the diatonic-chromatic genus can serve for the general exponent 2ᵐ·3ⁿ·5², no matter how large _n_ is.

11. The daily compositions of musicians abundantly testify to the position and applicability of the diatonic-chromatic genus. Almost all modern compositions have exponents more composite than 2ᵐ·3³·5². The composers themselves, considering the matter with highest rigor, are forced to agree that the usual tones are not sufficient, but they would rather use these tones than make the treatment of music more difficulty by introducing new tones. 

12. Extension of the diatonic-chromatic genus by increasing the exponent of 5 is not so fruitful. Increasing the power of 5 adds tones to the usual ones, from which they differ by a diesis, which is more than a comma. Since the diesis is about half a semitone, this is a perceptible discrepancy. To make this clearer, we have added the following table showing an octave of the genus 2ᵐ·3³·5⁵.

[table p 215-216]

13. In this genus the new tones alternate with the usual ones, and each new one differs from its principal tone by a diesis. Since this is a perceptible difference, the new tones can scarcely be omitted. Moreover, some of these tones are closer to the preceding principals than to the succeeding ones from which the letter names were borrowed. For example, the tone _G♯*_ is nearer to _G_ than it is to _G♯_, and hence it would be suitable to use _G_ in its place. This would present great difficulty since _G_ should be used in place of _G*_, and the distinct tones _G*_ and _G♯*_ cannot be expressed by the same tone. For such music it would be more suitable to divide the octave into twenty-four intervals. Such a genus has a further distinction of nearly equal intervals.

14. This new genus, with an octave having twice as many tones as our customary genus, would have a more extended application. If we take the exponent 2ᵐ·3³·5ᵖ, where _p_ is greater than 5, the resulting genus will accommodate all such subgenera as 2ᵐ·3³·5⁵. 2ᵐ·3³·5ᵖ would suffice for the universal genus 2ᵐ·3ⁿ·5ᵖ, unless _n_ and _p_ are exceedingly large numbers; but harmony does not permit substitution of such large numbers for _n_ and _p_.

15. The harmony will be impaired if the diatonic-chromatic genus, 2ᵐ·3³·5², is extended to works with exponents larger than 2ᵐ·7·5². Although there is no law saying that 3 cannot have an exponent larger than 7, yet the laws of harmony itself oppose composition of such works with a more composite exponent. Hence, it is not suitable to extend the use of this accepted genus beyond musical works with exponents contained in 2ᵐ·3⁷·5², and modern musicians are not accustomed to exceed this limit.

16. In order that the accepted genus 2ᵐ·3³·5² may satisfy the more composite genus 2ᵐ·3⁷·5², a double tone is affixed to each pitch or key as designated in the table of section 9. For example, the keys designated as _B_ will show the tones under the exponent 2ᵐ·3²·5 as well as those under 2ᵐ·3⁶. The following table shows what key should be used for any tone contained in the exponent 2ᵐ·3⁷·5². _F_ is denoted by 2ⁿ, where _n_ is an arbitrary fixed number. 

[table p 218-220]

17. Thus this table shows the proper key for producing both the principal and the secondary tones. The principal tones are derived from the exponent 2ᵐ·3³·5², and the key should be adjusted to those tones are accurately as possible. The secondary tones cannot be produced so accurately by the same keys. Since they differ so little from the principal tones, these keys can be used safely for playing them without perceptible detriment to the harmony. Sharper ears can detect the comma or diaschisma differences between the principal and secondary tones, but since secondary tones cannot be mixed with principals in the same consonance or in a succession of two consonance, the error cannot be perceived by the most acute hearing. For example, if the key _F_ where to be used in the first consonance to express the tone 2ⁿ, the same key can safely be used in the one hundred and first consonance to play the tone 2ⁿ⁻¹¹·3⁴·5².

18. This table shows what keys must be struck to play a series of tones or consonances given in numbers. For accomplishing this, it is necessary that the number _n_ be chosen so that all the given numbers may be found in the table, provided that the ratio of the greatest to the smallest does not exceed 16:1. Therefore, the number _n_ should be derived from either the largest or the smallest of the given numbers. After this, the proper keys for the remaining tones will be obtained easily, provided that the least common multiple of the given numbers is contained in 2ᵐ·3⁷·5².

19. Therefore, all musical works to which our diatonic-chromatic genus is accommodated are comprehended in this exponent 2ᵐ·3⁷·5², so that all works of other exponents cannot be played by instruments tuned according to this genus. Hence, the exponents of all musical works should be composed solely of the numbers 2, 3, 5, and their powers, with restriction that the powers of 3 and 5 not exceed 7 and 2, respectively. Leibnitz has stated that in music it is not customary to count beyond 5.<fn>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz (1646-1716), German philosopher and mathematician. Euler concludes in a later treatise, _Du véitable caractère de la musique moderne_ (1764), that "music has now learned to count to seven." See Introduction on Euler and seven.</fn>

20. Besides these three numbers, it would be very difficult to introduce into music any other number, say, 7, since consonances with a 7 in their exponents would be harsh and disturbing to the harmony. If the exponents had factors of 7 and 2 only, the consonances would hardly be accepted because of the absence of the more agreeable intervals arising from 3 and 5. If 7, 3, and 5 are joined to produce the exponent 2ᵐ·3·5·7, the consonance would be too composite to please the hearing. However, the following table is added to show the tones in one octave of the genus with an exponent of 2ᵐ·3³·5²·7.

[table pp. 222-223]


CHAPTER XI

ON CONSONANCES IN THE DIATONIC-CHROMATIC GENUS

1. The tones in the diatonic-chromatic genus are clearly shown in Section 16 of the preceding chapter. There we defined not only the tones which the keys of instruments represent, but also the secondary tones which can be quite satisfactorily represented by the same keys. We will not proceed to the consonances and will find out what consonances can be formed in the diatonic-chromatic genus. We will also show the proper keys to represent each consonance.

2. Multiplication of tones by 2 or 1/2 will raise or lower them by one octave, and tones differing by one or more octaves are considered alike but not the same. Thus, consonances with exponents differing only by powers of two may properly be considered as similar. A collection of such similar consonances will be designated by the name of the kind of consonances. For example, 2ᵐ·3·5 indicates a certain species of consonances, and the individual consonances constituting this species will arise when specific numbers are substituted for _m_.

3. Henceforth we will express such a species of consonances in the form _2ᵐ·A_, where _m_ is an indefinite number and _A_ is a fixed odd integer. The particular consonances of this species will be determined by these exponents: _A_, _2A_, _2²A_, _2³A_, _2⁴A_, etc. The tones constituting these consonances will be expressed by the same letters in each, and he difference will lie only in the octaves by which the tones of these consonances differ from each other. This difference will not greatly affect the nature of the consonance. 

4. Yet these consonances included in one species should not be considered exactly the same, for they certainly differ with respect to the agreeableness with which they are perceived by the hearing. Thus, if a consonance of exponent _A_ belongs to the degree of agreeableness _n_, then the consonance _2A_ belongs to the degree _n+1_, _2²A_ to _n+2_, _2³A_ to _n+3_, etc. Hence, the simplest and most easily perceived of consonances of the same species will be the one with exponent _A_. Next in order of agreeableness will be the consonance _2A_, then _2²A_, and so on.

5. The largest we make _m_ in 2ᵐ·A, the more composite and difficult of perception the consonance becomes. Since our perception is not boundless, a limit should be fixed in the degrees of agreeableness beyond which consonances cannot be made more composite. Such a limit can be determined only be experience. It is established that musicians very rarely use consonances more composite than those which belong to degree XII. When they do use the more composite ones, the results are not satisfactory. Therefore, let us adopt this limit and forbid consonances which exceed it. 

6. Let us now enumerate and discuss the consonances which can be formed in our diatonic-chromatic genus and whose exponents are contained in the exponent 2ᵐ·3³·5². Although this genus also satisfies the exponent 2ᵐ·3⁷·5², yet, as we have indicated, consonances cannot be used which are not contained in 2ᵐ·3³·5². Thus we will have the following twelve species of consonances:

[table p226]

7. If indices are added to the above exponents, these species of consonances can occur in several forms. Each exponent _2ᵐ·A_ can be combined with any index _B_ so that the species may be expressed as _2ᵐA(B)_, provided that _2ᵐAB_ is a divisor of 2ᵐ·3⁷·5², granting this wider extension to the diatonic-chromatic genus. Since the base of each consonance is the tone denoted by unity, the base of the consonance 2ᵐ·A(B) is _B_, so that, no matter how the index _B_ is varied, the consonances expressed by 2ᵐ·A(B) differ only in the ratio of the bases.

8. Since it is our purpose to examine particular consonances and since they are not changed by the indices, we will disregard the indices here, or, rather, we will take unity as index. Consonances represented in this way can easily be transferred to any index by substituting the tone expressed by the index in place of the tone designated by unity and by substituting for the others, tones differing from the base by the same intervals. In this chapter the base will always be either the tone _F_ or the same tone one or more octaves below _F_, since we may indicate _F_ or a tone differing from _F_ by one or more octaves by 1.

9. In all the consonances which we will discuss here, the tone or key _F_ will be indicated by unity, two, or a power of two, according to the circumstances. We will show all consonances within an interval of three octaves, thereby neglecting tones lowering than _F_ and higher than _f̅̅_.
Since by this plan we can rarely show complete consonances, the key _F_ will be denoted variously be 1, 2, 4, etc., so that we may obtain in our three-octave interval all forms in which any consonance can appear. 

10. For representing these tones we will use two ordinary five-lined staves, one with the bass clef and the other with the discant clef,<fn>The soprano clef. The treble clef is used in this translation. See pp. 235-236.</fn> on which, in the usual way, we will so place the consonances that all notes will be contained within the limits of the staves. Here is the reason for using no tones lower than _F_ or higher than _f̅̅_. A wider span cannot be taken because of any substitutions for _F_ and several successive consonances do not require a greater interval than four octaves.

11. In this way, using the usual musical notation, we have represented the consonances of each species in order of agreeableness. Above each consonance we have added the exponent; between staves, the degree of agreeableness; and below, the number which indicates the tone _F_ in each case. We have gone as far as degree XII in the first part of this table, showing only consonances more often used. However, we subsequently continue the consonances through degree XV. These should be considered dissonances. Several species cannot carried that far because they cannot be represented in such a small interval. If the consonance 2³ of the first species cannot be exhibited within an interval of three octaves, then surely those consonances following 2³ cannot. Therefore, these are omitted. 

12. This table begins with the unison or simple tone, which is certainly the simplest consonance. This is followed by the consonance called an octave, which has two tones differing by the interval of an octave. This, the simplest consonance after the unison, is very easily perceived. For producing it, two strings can easily be toned by hearing alone. The third consonance has three tones which differ from each other by octaves and producing pleasing harmony. These three consonances are the only ones of the first species which can be exhibited with the three-octave interval.

13. The second species includes those consonances in which occur the intervals of the fourth and fifth, in addition to the octave. The fifth can be made simplest by increasing it an octave, so that the octave plus a fifth not only is more pleasing to the hearing than the simple fifth but may be used more successfully for tuning instruments. For example, it is much easier to obtain _c̅_ than _c_ from a fixed _F_. Hence, anyone wishing to tune instruments by ear only will be helped considerably by using octaves plus fifths instead of simple fifths. The remaining consonances of this species occur often and are very agreeable to the hearing. 

14. The simplest consonance of the third species is the double octave plus a major third. This interval is much more pleasing than either the simple major third or the octave plus major third. Hence, it is of greater service in tuning instruments successfully than the simple major third. If the tones in this interval seem too far apart, then at least the octave plus major third can be used. It is highly expedient to use these aids in tuning musical instruments according to the rules previously treated, since the prescribed operation is made easier and the results are more exact.

15. These are the three simplest species, of which the first has only one tone and the other two have two tones, if we consider tones differing by octaves as the same. Because of their great simplicity, these species are rarely used except in _bicinia_ or two-part pieces. The succeeding species have a greater number of tones, so that they can be used suitably in polyphonic compositions. The fourth species has three tones: _F_, _C_, _G_. Composers often use this species in adding to the bass either a fifth a second or a seventh and a fourth. These consonances are usually called dissonances by musicians, not so much because they are less agreeable as because the musicians are accustomed to refer only to members of species I, II, III, and V as consonances.

16. The fifth species supplies music with more composite consonances as well as with several dissonances. The two consonances at the beginning of the fifth species consist of the tones _F_, _A_, _C_ and _A_, _C_, _E_, respectively.  Regardless of the arrangement of these tones, thes two consonances are usually called harmonic triads. Principal triads are those in which the lowest tone differs from one of the others by a major or minor third and from the other by a fifth. If tones are arranged in another order, we have the subordinate triads.

17. An harmonic triad is called _major_ or _minor_, depending on whether the major or minor third is united with the fifth. Thus, the triad _F_, _A_, _C_ is major, and _A_, _C_, _E_ is minor. Our table shows clearly how each is to be expressed by agreeably and how much agreeableness is lost if the tones are arranged in another order. We will have more to say below about the best way of expressing each consonance or _chord_, as the musicians call it.

18. Besides these two triads, this fifth species contains several arrangements which musicians call dissonances and which are shown in the table. Composers usually use only major and minor triads for consonances and fill most of their works with them. With these they merely intermix all the remaining consonances, which are treated as secondary and are called dissonances, even though they may have just as much or more agreeableness than the triads, according as these triads are formed.

19. The consonances of the sixth species are very harsh, since the simplest which can be arranged in the three-octave span belongs to the eleventh degree. Therefore, it is very rarely used by composers, and it is rarely suitable to use it. Consonances of the seventh and eighth species are more tolerable and can be intermixed agreeably with simpler consonances. Because of the excessive harshness of the consonances of species IX and X, they can be used only with the greatest caution. Of the last two species, no consonances can be shown which would not exceed the twelfth degree. Therefore, the consonances--or dissonances, rather-- of these species will be found in another part of the table.

20. At this point useful rules can be deduced, as far as possible, for agreeably producing the _basso continuo_, which consists of figures added to the lowest tone to indicate the highest tones which are to be sounded with it to produce a consonance. These tones are indicated by numbers derived from the usual interval names, so that 6 indicates that a sixth is to be added to the bass; 7, a seventh; and so forth. These numbers can indicate either simple or composite intervals, according to the circumstances. Which of these is best to be used is left to the skill of the musician. 

21. We will begin our treatment of such rules with the simple intervals by which a single tone should be joined to the bass. If an octave is indicated, it is more agreeable to make the interval a simple octave than to use the double or triple octave. If the perfect or imperfect fifth is prescribed (imperfect fifths are considered as perfect in this matter), it is more suitable to use the octave plus fifth than to use the simple fifth. On the other hand, the simple fourth is more agreeable to the hearing than the fourth plus one or more octaves. Therefore, if perchance circumstances prohibit use of the simple fourth, the upper tone should be as close to the bass as possible. 

22. If the major third is prescribed, it is proper to use that interval plus two octaves rather than the simple one. The minor third, on the contrary, is more pleasing if use is made of the simple interval or at least one with its upper tone as closer to the bass as possible. Major and minor sixths are more agreeable the smaller the interval. The same is true of the minor seventh, but the major seventh if more pleasing the further its upper tone is from the bass. The major second consisting of a major tone should have a very wide span; the major second consisting of a minor tone should have as small a span as possible, as is also the case with the minor second. The further the upper tone of the tritone lies from the bass, the less agreeableness will be disturbed.

23. These rules should be observed if one tone is added to the bass. This is the least frequent arrangement, but these rules are equally useful and valid when several tones are added to the bass, since each added tone can be treated individually. The next table shows how tones may be most agreeably expressed if several numbers are added to the bass. This table is formed from the preceding one by omitting several of the lowest tones so that each tone of the bass may be represented.

24. To represent these things clearly, it was necessary to use three five-lined staves,<fn>See pp. 237-239.</fn> the lowest of which has only the bass notes with numbers above, as is usually done with _basso continuo_ or _generalbass_. The other two staves present the whole consonance by which the numbers added to the bass are most suitably and agreeably expressed. We have used the key of C here, but by transposition it will be easy to extend the use of this table to any other key and to other tones. As before, we have indicated the degree of agreeableness and the species to which each consonance belongs. This table also consists of two parts. One has consonances up to species X, and the other gives consonances of species XI and species XII.

CHAPTER XII

ON MODES AND SYSTEMS IN THE DIATONIC-CHROMATIC GENUS

1. After the consonances of the diatonic-chromatic genus it would be appropriate to deal with the series of consonances. But since a series of consonances must be adapted to the musical mode, it seems more advantageous to enumerate and discuss the modes before we deal with the rules for connecting consonances in any mode. By fixing the limits between which we should remain in joining consonances, it will be easier to explain the pattern of composition and to make musical harmony.

2. Since a musical mode is nothing but an exponent of a series of consonances and the modal exponent contains in itself the exponents of the individual consonances, it is clear that the modal exponent cannot be very simple, else there would not be sufficient variety in the consonances. For this reason we reject the exponents, 2ⁿ, 2ⁿ·3, 2ⁿ·3², 2ⁿ·3·5, and 2ⁿ·5² as unserviceable for designating modes and begin our treatment with more composite exponents.

3. Since the modal exponent should be contained in 2ⁿ·3³·5², which is the exponent of the diatonic-chromatic genus, we have six modes whose exponents are as follows:
	I. 2ⁿ·3³ 				IV. 2ⁿ·3³·5
	II. 2ⁿ·3²·5				V. 2ⁿ·3²·5²
	III. 2ⁿ·3·5² 			VI. 2ⁿ·3³·5²
Although the diatonic-chromatic genus may extend beyond the exponent 2ⁿ·3³·5², yet the mode cannot be more composite, not only lest it should become imperceptible, but also lest in the same mode the same key would have to be used for expressing two different tones. This would be intolerable.

4. Since modes are frequently changed in a whole musical work and there are transitions from one mode to another, then the whole work's exponent, which contains the exponents of all modes, can be more composite than 2ⁿ·3³·5² and can go as high as 2ⁿ·3⁷·5² without damage to the harmony. Hence, the following law will have to be established for composing complete works: Every mode is contained in the exponent 2ⁿ·3³·5², and the exponent of the whole work may not be more composite than 2ⁿ·3⁷·5².

5. Of the six modes listed, the first three are too simple and have less importance in modern music since they do not permit the variety which pleases in the music of today. Yet, except for the first, which yields no thirds or sixths, they may still be used for simple harmony and melody. The second mode is quite suitable for expressing easy, cheerful melodies consisting of the simpler consonances. This mode is often used by composers. Although the third mode occurs most rarely, yet it can also be used suitably in such simple melodies.

6. All of modern music is comprehended in the last three modes. All the kinds of modes which musicians are accustomed to use are contained in these three modes. The mode designated as major by musicians belongs to our fourth mode; the minor mode, to our fifth. For the most part, composers today use a mode composed of both major and minor which belongs to our sixth mode, which is abundantly evident in today's compositions. 

7. As we express them without indices, these modes all have as a base the tone _F_, which is indicated by unity or some power of two. Any mode can be transposed by transferring the base to another tone, without changing the nature of the mode. Occurring very frequently in music, these transpositions, or variations of modes, as we will call them, will be indicated by indices connected with exponents, so that the index will be designated as the base or the tonic to which the mode itself belongs. Thus, if the index is 3, the base of the mode will be the tone _C_; and if the index is 5, the base will be _A_, as is understood from our earlier discussion.

8. A variation is called _pure_ if the exponent of the mode, joined with the index, is contained in the true exponent, 2ⁿ·3³·5², of the diatonic-chromatic genus. However, if the combination of the modal exponent and the index is more composite than 2ⁿ·3³·5² but contained in 2ⁿ·3⁷·5², then we will call this variation _impure_, since the tones of the musical genus agree approximately but not exactly. Any variation not contained in the exponent 2ⁿ·3⁷·5² will rightly be considered unlawful and contrary to harmony. 

9. The first mode, with exponent 2ⁿ·3³, has three pure variations: 2ⁿ·3³(1), 2ⁿ·3³(5), 2ⁿ·3³(5²), with bases F, A, and C♯. It has twelve impure variations which are given below with their bases:

[blah table p 243, italicized places mentioned below]

The secondary tones--_A_, _C♯_, and _F_-- are italicized.

10. The next table presents all the variations--pure and impure-- of each mode, and for each variation we have added the key indicating the base. Since all the consonances also admit of such variation and since it is useful to know which of them are pure or impure, this table shows variations of both consonances and modes.<fn>Part One deals with the modes rejected in Section 2 of this chapter, and these may be interpreted as species II-VI of consonances. (See Section 6, Chapter XI.) Part Two deals with the six modes of Section 3 of this chapter. This division of the table has been made by the translator for clarification.</fn>

11. This table shows how many pure and impure variations are possible for any consonance or any any mode on a correctly tuned instrument. Thus it appears that the harmonic triad, which is contained in the exponent 2ⁿ·3·5, has six pure and eight impure variations. Yet three of the impure agree with the pure, since the secondary bases _A_, _E_, and _B_ also appear as primary bases. Therefore, there are actually only five impure variations to be considered: those with bases of D, F♯, C♯, D♯, and G♯. This table also shows the pure and impure transpositions of modes. Easily found is the interval by which a given melody can be transposed and remain pure or become impure. Unlawful cases are also easily detected. Whatever is said about one variation of a certain mode can easily be applied to others.

12. Having considered the various modal variations, we should now consider the species of any mode which arise when definite numbers are substituted for the indefinite exponent of two. Thus, by substituting the successive positive integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., for _n_, the species of the mode 2ⁿ·3³·5 are expressed by the following exponents: 3³·5, 2·3³·5, 2²·3³·5, 2³·3³·5, 2⁴·3³·5, and so forth. All species of a mode have the same pure and impure variations as the mode itself, since the variations are determined, not from the power of two which is in the modal exponent, but only from the index numbers 3 and 5, which are not changed in the species. 

13. Species of the same mode differ among themselves with regard to the degrees agreeableness to which they belong. The simpler the species of any mode is, the smaller is the number substituted for _n_. Thus the simplest species of any mode results when _n_=0. When _n_=1, the species becomes more composite by one degree. Making _n_=2 increases the degree again by 1, and so on. This is clear from what has been said previously about finding the degree of agreeableness to which any fixed exponent belongs. 

14. The number of species of any mode would appear to be infinite because of the unlimited number of fixed values which can be substituted for _n_. But since the senses do not comprehend an infinite number, the fixed interval between the highest and lowest audible pitches determines the number of species in any mode. Any mode comprehends in itself a given number of primitive tones which are repeated in different octaves by increasing _n_. Thus, if the same tone occurs in all octaves, further increase of _n_ can effect no greater diversity. 

15. In order that this may be clearer, it should be noted that the primitive tones of each mode are expressed by odd numbers from which the derivatives arise by multiplication by 2 or its powers. The greater this power of 2 is, the more derivative tones arise from a particular primitive. A fixed number of octaves are so filled by these tones that there is room for no more, even if the power of 2 is increased further. These things will be quite clear from the tables which follow.

16. A third variety of any mode or species is produced by accommodation to the customary system of tones in musical instruments. This system usually spans four octaves. The lowest tone is designated as C and the highest as c. If they are to be played by instruments, the tones of any mode and species should be contained within these limits. Thus the tones lower than C and higher than c cannot be used and must be disregarded. The group of tones contained within the given limits and belonging to any species will be called the _system_ of that species.

17. The same species can often be included in several ways within that fixed interval of tones, depending upon the power of 2 by which F is expressed. If F=1, all the tones with numbers greater than 12 must be rejected. If F=2, only the tones expressed by numbers between 2 an 24 can be used. If F=4, the numbers lie between 3 an 48, and if F=8, the limits are 6 and 96. Similarly, we can find the limits for other powers of 2 representing F.

18. Thus the system of each modal species is defined by the power of 2 taken to indicate F. Clearly, the same species may h ave several systems which consist of various groups of tones. Such a system of tones, which are possessed by a given species determined by a given mode, is usually called _ambitus_ by musicians. The _ambitus_ determines the tones from the diatonic-chromatic genus which can be used in a given melody. Musicians recognize only one _ambitus_ for each mode. However, the following table will show that any mode or modal species admits of several systems or _ambitus_ by which music can still be wonderfully variegated. 

19. Therefore, in order to have a comprehensive look at all species and systems of each mode, I have added the following table in which the six modes described above are arranged so that the reader may examine each modal species and its corresponding system for each exponent indicating F. With the four-octave limit, this table includes all species of each mode and all systems in which the keys are designated by the usual signs.

[long table from page 253 to 264]

20. The following matters concerning musical composition should be observed. In the first place, a definite species and system in a particular mode should be chosen for the creation of the composition. With a selected system, all the tones which can occur in this composition are fixed, so that as long as you use this system, no tones other than those designated can be used, unless the instrument can produce tones lower than C and higher than c̅̅̅; but in this case, only such tones can be used as are contained in the exponent of the species. The exponent itself will give this information. 

21. The first mode in this table has an exponent of 2ⁿ·3³. Since the tone expressed by 3³ or 27 must be present, no system exists for F=1 or F=2 since the tone 27 would exceed the upper limit c̅̅̅. Hence, we begin with F=4, with 3³ corresponding to d̅̅. Besides d̅̅, we must have a tone indicated by 1 or a power of 2. in this case, _n_ must be at least 2 or the tone will not lie in the specified interval. Thus the first system has the exponent 2²·3³, if we take F=4.

22. When F=4 the mode 2ⁿ·3³ has four systems, which exponents of 2²·3³, 2³·3³, 2⁴·3³, and 2⁵·3³. This mode has no others which can be contained in the four-octave span. Even if we take 2⁶·3³ as exponent, the tones would correspond to those of the exponent 2⁵·3³. Thus we would not actually have a different system. If F=8, we again have four systems. This is also true of F=16 and F=32, where again a limit is reached. In the last system, which has an exponent of 2^8·3³, all the primitive tones are present in each octave and therefore a more composite system cannot be produced.

23. Thus the first mode, 2ⁿ·3³, has sixteen systems; the second mode, 2ⁿ·3²·5, has thirty-three; and the third mode, 2ⁿ·3·5², has thirty. The fourth mode, 2ⁿ·3³·5, very widely used by musicians today, has thirty-six different systems. The fifth mode, 2ⁿ·3²·5², also widely used, has forty-eight. The sixth mode, which is composite and is also frequently used, has sixty-six different systems. These six modes, then, comprise a total of 229 different systems. 

24. Careful analysis of the forms of all these systems reveals that each octave of each system is differently constituted, with the exception of the last system of each mode. The individual octaves of each of these final systems have an equal number of tones and contain all the primitive tones of the mode. Some systems have more tones in their lowest octaves; others, in their middle octaves; and still others, in their upper octaves. From these may be chosen the most suitable system for a given composition. If it is desired to place the main parts of a melody in the bass, the system chosen should have the greatest number of tones in its lower octave, but if the greatest variety is desired in the soprano, the upper octaves should have the greatest number of tones. If the middle voices are to be emphasized, a similar procedure would apply to selection of a suitable system. Modern composers, influenced by experience rather than theory, seem to have noticed to a degree this great difference in modes. Therefore, our enumeration will be of no little help by enabling them to see clearly that which they have previously understood only vaguely. 


CHAPTER XIII

ON THE PROCESS OF COMPOSITION IN A GIVEN MODE AND A GIVEN SYSTEM


1. The exponent of a composition is most often so composite that it cannot be perceived at all, unless it is determined gradually. Therefore, such a composition must be divided into several parts of which the exponents will be simpler and more easily perceived. Before discussing creation of a whole composition, it is necessary to explain composition of the parts which constitute the whole work when joined together. The exponent of such a part is nothing but a musical mode. Hence, we should discuss the matter of composition in a given mode before going on to the creation of a whole work. Then we will discuss the subject of joining such parts together to make the whole composition.

2. Although the discussion of the doctrine of modes in the preceding chapter was more extensive and accurate than the usual treatment, and although each mode was divided into its species and systems, the composer still has to choose a mode for his composition and a system for that mode. We are not concerned here with variations of modes, since they are merely the result of transposition and since the mutual relationship of the tones in any system is not changed. Hence, in all systems the base or the tone expressed by unity will be the key F, or another tone, one or more octaves lower.

3. When we have chosen a mode suitable to our purpose, we must find an appropriate species and system. Although this depends on the judgment of the composer, yet in a measure the purpose itself determines the system, as we have already noted in the previous chapter. If one wishes to give greater emphasis to a particular octave, he will favor a system in which that octave has the greatest number of tones. A knowledge of the table given earlier is sufficient for this, an additional discussion would be superfluous.

4. For a fixed system of a given mode and species, the table of systems shows all the tones which can be used in a composition, and the tones belonging to the particular system can be distinguished from others. If the pattern of our systems is applied to their works, it can be seen that a similar limit is constantly observed by the more skilled composers. Clearly, the upper voice in a composition may use harsher intervals while the lower voice has softer intervals, without being contrary to the rules of harmony. Consider the system of mode 2ⁿ·3³·5, species 2⁶·3³·5, when F=32. This system is so arranged that keys F and _f_ are in its two lower octaves and _f̅♯_, and _f̅̅♯_ are in its two upper octaves. To the uninformed this would seem to be a great defect. Similarly, many other arrangements, which seem paradoxical but agreeable to practical musicians, will be verified by this table of systems and will be reconciled with the principles of harmony. It is impossible for a piece to please if it is not in agreement with our principles of harmony.

5. A composition in a selected fixed system admits of the greatest variety. Since a composition is created by arranging a number of consonances in a series, the other and nature of the consonances present almost infinite possibilities for diversity. The consonances may be chosen from the same species or from different species, and the resulting composition is either _simple_ or _mixed_. We will designate a _simple_ composition as one which consists of consonances of the same species or expressed by the same exponent. A composition will be _mixed_ if its consonances are of various species.

6.First, let us consider the type of simple composition which consists only of simple tones or of consonances expressed by the exponent 1. Such a composition is said to have one voice since only one tone sounds at a time. This type is often used in pieces for several voices when all harmony is left to one voice. 

7. Such a composition consisting of simple tones worked out with almost no difficulty. With any system selected from the given table, all tones which can be used in the composition can be seen at one glance. Therefore, anyone can mixed these tones of the selected system as he pleases and form from them a suitable melody. The only other observation that should be made here is that excessively harsh successions of tones should be avoided when the exponent of the chosen system is quite composite. In the simpler systems there are no tones with an unpleasant succession.

8. With a selected system it is good to examine those tonal successions which are difficult to perceive and either to avoid them or to use them for moving the spirit to sadness. Much charm is added to the harmony if sparing use is made of those tones which belong to a given system but are not in the simpler systems. But those tones which are in common with those of the simpler systems may occur more often. 

9. Since a series of consonances in a given system must arise from either the same same species or from different species, then we must first show how and by what tones any consonance is to be expressed in that system. our exponents and indices indicate consonances with respect to others and the tones constituting these consonances, but, for a given system one could also note what number expresses the key F. Hence, for forming a given consonance with the most suitable tones, one must consider, in addition to the exponent and index, the power of 2 by which F is indicated in the chosen system. 

10. For this purpose I have added the following table which shows the tones by which any consonance is to be expressed for a given value of F. The first column gives the exponents and indices of the consonances. The other gives the value of F for a particular system and the form for expressing the consonance. Thus, if the consonance 2⁴·3·5(3²) is to be expressed in the system for F=32, the table shows that it consists of the tones

D:G:B:d:g:b:d̅:f̅♯:g̅:b̅:d̅̅:f̅̅♯:b̅̅.

From these tones one may choose those suitable for his purpose.

[table p 272-319 (30+ pages)]

11. Thus, from this table all consonances which do not go beyond the twelfth degree of agreeableness can be expressed in a given system. I have omitted more composite consonances since composers rarely use them and since the harmony is more disturbed than perfected by them. In the consonances represented in this table, there is so much diversity and there are so many kinds of dissonances, as the musicians call them, that it would be superfluous and harmful to the harmony to use other more composite consonances.

12. This table may seem to be defective since only odd numbers are used for the indices joined to the exponents. Nevertheless, consonances having even numbers for indices can be expressed with the aid of this table. Consider a consonance E(21) for a system F=2ⁿ, where _E_ is the exponent and _i_ is an odd number. Now find the form of the consonance E(i) for the system F=2ⁿ and transpose all the tones an octave higher, or, with an equivalent result, take the form of the consonance E(i) for the system F=2ⁿ⁻¹.

13. Similarly, if the consonance to be expressed is E(41) and if F=2ⁿ, then we may either find the consonance E(i) for F=2ⁿ in the table and transpose each tone two octaves higher or take the consonance E(i) for F=2ⁿ⁻². In general, we may find the form of a consonance E(2ᵐi) with the aid of our table by finding the consonance E(i) for F=2ⁿ⁻ᵐ. If F=2ⁿ⁻ᵐ cannot be found in the table, then we take the consonance E(i) for the system F=2ⁿ and transpose each tone _m_ octaves higher.

14. Therefore, when a consonance to be expressed has an even number as its index, then the index may be divided by the power of 2 producing an odd number as quotient. Then the value of F in the chosen system may be divided by the same power of 2, and, for that system, the consonance may be expressed with an odd index resulting from the even index. Consider, for example, the consonance 2³·3·5(12) for F=32. Divide 12 and 32 by 4 and replace them by 3 and 8. The desired consonance will be found in the table by looking for the consonance 2³·3·5(3) under F=8. Its tones are
C:G:c:e:g:c̅:e̅:g̅:b̅:e̅̅:g̅̅:b̅̅.

15. However, if there is no correspondence in the table between the value of F for the system in which the composition is undertaken and the exponent plus index of the consonance, then that consonance cannot be expressed at all because of the tones which are too low for the instruments. In order to express it as a consonance which is at least similar, it is necessary to multiply the index by 2 or by a power of 2 so that the quotient may be found in the table if the value of F from the chosen system is divided by this same power of 2. For example, if F=64, the consonance 2³·3·5(1) cannot be expressed by the usual tones. For this reason, we can substitute the consonance 2³·3·5(4), which, if referred to the system F=16, agrees with 2³·3·5(1) and has the following tones:
C:E:A:c:e:a:e̅:e̅̅.

16. Having discussed formation of consonances, we will now proceed to the process of composing in a given system. The exponent of a system not only determines all the simple tones in that system, but also defines all the consonances belonging to that system. A consonance belongs to a system if the product of its exponent and index is a factor of the exponent of the system. Therefore, it is a simple matter to determine all the consonances in a given system.

17. First of all, we should determine whether it is suitable to use one kind or several kinds of consonances, so that all the consonances in a given system may be enumerated more easily. We will consider these ten genera of consonances:
[table]
The two remaining genera of consonances, 2ⁿ·3²·5² and 2ⁿ·3³·5², are excluded since they represent only consonances which exceed the twelfth degree.

18. Having chosen one or more of these genera, we should find out how many species and variations of them are contained in the exponent of the system. The species of each kind are determined by substituting definite numbers for n in 2ⁿ; the variations are determined by the indices joined with the exponents. To enumerate the consonances, we first divide the exponent of the system by the exponents of the individual species and find all the divisors of the quotients. Then we successively substitute these divisors for the indices. 

19. In compositions of several voices, composers most frequently use the fifth genus, which has an exponent of 2ⁿ·3·5, since it has not only all harmonic triads but also several so-called dissonances. Besides these dissonances they also often use consonances from genera IV, VIII, and X as dissonances, but they hardly ever use genera VI, VII, and IX. only [sic] the simpler genera, I, II, and III, are serviceable for compositions of two or three voices, since the consonances of other genera, for the most part, have too many tones.

20. For example, let us consider the system with an exponent of 2⁵·3³·5 and F=8. The following species and variations of the consonances of the fifth genus are contained in this exponent:

[table p 324]

21. From the fourth genus in this system we have the following consonances, which can be used as dissonances by composers:

[table p 325]

22. The seventh, eighth, and tenth genera furnish the following consonances:

[table p 326-327]

23. If we now take from the table of consonances as many consonances for F=8 as can be expressed, we will have the following supply of consonances and dissonances:

[table p 327-331]

24. Note the huge supply of consonances and dissonances (as musicians call them) which can be used in just this one system. The number of consonances becomes much larger if the consonances of the first three genera, omitted in our enumeration, are added. Obviously, a tremendous variety of compositions are possible in only one system. There will be greater variety in more composite systems, which, of course, have more composite exponents. This will be apparent when the remaining systems are obtained in the same manner. 

25. After such an enumeration of the consonances and dissonances in a given system, it will not be difficult to produce a composition by intermixing consonances and dissonances at will. The agreeableness will be maintained at the highest level if one avoids excessively harsh successions of consonances--successions with exponents almost as composite as that of the system itself. Such successions should be avoided in those systems with quite composite exponents.

26. Since music especially delights with variety, it will usually be advantageous to interchange the consonances and not to place in succession several related ones, such as those which have exponents and indices differing only by powers of 2. This can be achieved by avoiding three or more consecutive consonances where the exponent of the succession differs greatly from the exponent of the system. The very nature of the system requires this, for unless the exponent of the whole system is contained in any part of the composition, the composition may easily appear to have lapsed into a simpler system. 

27. Although this is true of any part of a composition, as explained above, special attention should be given to the first part in order that the hearer may promptly recognize the exponent of the system from it. Therefore, at the beginning there should be a series of consonances with a joint exponent which will exhaust the exponent of the system. These same rules should also be observed for the last part of the composition so that the end itself will make clear in what system the composition has been created.

28. Generally, modern composers carefully observe this rule in their works. They arrange their final cadences so that from them one may easily perceive the exponent of the whole system used in the last part. To make this clearer, it will help to consider a final cadence, embellished in the usual way, in the system previously discussed where the exponent is 2⁵·3³·5 and F=8. Musicians would call this C major. It is evident that if the tone _f_ were not present in the second consonances the exponents of these three successive consonances 

[fragment music p 333]

would be 2³·3²(2·3):2²·3·5(3²):2³·3·5(2·3). Since all of the indices are divisible by 3, the common exponent of these consonances taken together would be 2⁴·3²·5, which certainly is much simpler than 2⁵·3³·5, the exponent of the system. For this reason and agreeable to the given rule, the tone _f_ with exponent 2⁵ is added so that the exponent of the whole cadence becomes 2⁵·3³·5. The cadence thus conveys the whole nature and character of the system. 

29. Yet this freedom of the composers might seem to audacious and contrary to the laws of harmony as they now stand, since the addition of _f_ to the middle consonance makes its exponent 2⁵·3³·5, thus classifying it under the sixteenth degree of agreeableness, which can hardly be endured.<fn>Some major and minor triads in Euler's genus have degrees exceeding this. See Appendix B.</fn> However, there is another explanation for all this. It rests upon another foundation which is usually observed by composers with respect to dissonances, considering each individually, and we have not touched upon the subordinate consonances.

30. This distinction arises chiefly from the nature of the measure of which some parts are considered principal, others, subordinate. The latter are filled with the subordinate consonances which can have higher degrees of agreeableness than the principal consonances without damage to harmony, provided that they are used with system, and their degree of agreeableness should not be considered so much as their role in the connection of the principal consonances. 

31. A connection between two tones of principal consonances is made by the interpolation of intermediates. For example, _f_ is inserted between _g_ and _e_ and the two consonances are now connected, as in the given example. Such insertions of tones which do not properly belong to the consonances are made for the sake of the transition and are therefore bearable. Tones not contained in the consonances are also used frequently in the smaller note values without disturbing harmony.

32. Although the use of such tones pertains to florid and connected composition, yet we should note that they should be contained in the system and should be used on weak beats. The reason why these tones do not disturb the harmony lies in the facts that they are contained in the system and that they convey the idea of the system to the listener more fully than the consonances alone can do. The rules which should be observed in handling these tones have been copiously set forth by musicians. 


CHAPTER XIV

ON CHANGE OF MODES AND SYSTEMS

1. However manifold the variety to be found in a single system, it is inevitable that distaste will replace pleasure if one system is retained too long. Since music requires variety and agreeableness in tones and consonances, the object of hearing must be changed often. The exponent of a system is represented to the hearing through composition as treated in the preceding chapter, and the system should be changed as soon as the ear has sufficiently recognized the exponent.

2. This change can be effected in many ways. In the first place, with mode and species fixed, the system itself admits diverse changes. The change will be made more perceptible if there is a transition to another species of he mode or even to another mode; such changes can be acquired in abundance from the previously given tables of modes and systems. Moreover, the modes themselves and their individual species and systems admit many variations not shown in the table. These variations arise if the indices are combined with the exponents. In this way the greatest variety is injected into music.

3. Just as comparison of various consonances is accomplished by use of exponents and indices, so also the same mode assumes various forms by joining various indices. These forms do not appear in the table of Chapter XII where unity is used consistently as the index. In this chapter, where we propose to compare the various modes and systems and to show how to go from one to another, we will connect an index to the exponent of each mode and system.

4. In order that it may be clear how composition is accomplished in a system in which the exponent is joined with the index, we will begin with indices which are powers of 2. Therefore, let E(2ⁿ) be the exponent of the system for which F = 2ᵐ. it is clear that composition can be done in accordance with the exponent E, and then it should be made _n_ octaves higher. The several disadvantages of this process may be offset by doing the composition in the system of exponent E for the value F=2ᵐ⁻ⁿ. This also will belong to the given system.

5. If the index is not a power of 2, but is any other number _p_, composition in the system with exponent E(p), for the case F=2ᵐ, is done by composing in the system of exponent E and then raising each tone by an interval of 1:_p_. Since this process usually results in tones which are too high, the power of 2 nearest to _p_ may be taken. If this power is designated as 2ᵏ, the composition will be in the system of exponent E(2ᵏ) according to the previous case, and thus the whole composition will be transposed by the interval 2ᵏ:p. In this way, according to the rules in the preceding chapter, a musical composition can be composed in any system whose exponent is joined with an index.

6. If a work of music consists of several parts, each of which is in a particular system, then the first consideration should be the whole work's component, which is the least common multiple of the exponents of all the systems used. Conversely, if the exponent is chosen at will, the systems themselves and their exponents are derived in the same manner by which the exponents of individual consonances are derived from the exponent of a system. 

7. Having arbitrarily chosen an exponent to represent the whole musical work, one must also choose a power of 2 to represent the tone F, which should remain fixed in all systems. However, such a musical work may have systems in which F is designated by a smaller power of 2. This happens on account of the indices joined with the exponents of the systems, which, if the indices are equal, are reduced to systems in which smaller powers of 2 express the same tone F. These things are clear from the previously discussed process of composing in systems whose exponents are joined with indices.

8. Before defining the systems which are contained in the exponent of a musical work, it seems appropriate to list the modes contained in that exponent. We should examine not only the modes as represented by the exponents, but also each mode's individual variations, which are distinguished by the indices. From the modes will be derived species which, from the given value of F, furnish systems, any of which may be used to begin the composition according to the rules already developed.

9. If we except the simpler ones, the modes can be expressed principally by the two exponents 2ⁿ·3³·5 and 2ⁿ·3²·5². The mode with exponent 2ⁿ·3³·5² can be considered as a composite of these two. Musicians designate the first, 2ⁿ·3³·5, as the major mode and the second, 2ⁿ·3²·5², as the minor mode. Composers use these two almost exclusively in their works. Each of these modes admits many variations by joining indices to exponents. These variations have been given special names by musicians, as may be seen in the following table: 

Major Modes

2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ)					C Major
2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ·3)				G Major
2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ·5)				E Major
2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ·3²)				D Major
2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ·3·5)				B Major
2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ·3³)				A Major
2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ·3²·5)			F♯ Major
2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ·3⁴)				E Major
2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ·3³·5)			C♯ Major
2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ·3⁴·5)			G♯ Major


Minor Modes

2ⁿ·3²·5²(2ᵐ)				A Minor
2ⁿ·3²·5²(2ᵐ·3)				E Minor
2ⁿ·3²·5²(2ᵐ·3²)				B Minor
2ⁿ·3²·5²(2ᵐ·3³)				F♯ Minor
2ⁿ·3²·5²(2ᵐ·3⁴)				C♯ Minor
2ⁿ·3²·5²(2ᵐ·3⁵)				G♯ Minor

10. We have listed here only those variations which are contained in the exponent 2ⁿ·3⁷·5², which, as we have observed, can be expressed by the current diatonic-chromatic genus without discernible detriment to the harmony. We assigned these particular names to those modal variations because most of the systems of each of those modes include those very tones which are considered by musicians to constitute the _ambitus_ of the modes listed above. If one considers many of the systems of the mode 2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ) in the given table,<fn>See Section 19, Chapter XII. None of the species of the mode 2ⁿ·3ⁿ·5² produces a _D_, the fourth degree of the A minor scale.</fn> he will see that in them is contained the _ambitus_ of mode C major as designated by musicians. He will also note that the mode 2ⁿ·3²·5²(2ᵐ) contains the _ambitus_ of mode A minor.

11. In order to show what kinds of variations of these two modes may be used in any musical work, let us consider the exponents which can be applied to a whole musical work. As we have already shown, these exponents should not exceed 2ⁿ·3⁷·5², the exponent of the diatonic-chromatic system taken in the broader sense. Thus, 2ᵏ·3³·5² will be the simplest exponent from which compositions with modal variations can be created. It includes the following four modes:

2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ)					C Major
2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ·5)				E Major
2ⁿ·3²·5²(2ᵐ)				A Minor
2ⁿ·3²·5²(2ᵐ·3)				E Minor

Substitution of successive integers for _n_ and _m_ will produce all the species of these modes and their variations. The sum _m+n_ may not exceed _k_.

12. The greatest variety in compositions of this genus may be achieved by alternating the systems with each other so that it hardly seems necessary to demand compositions of more composite exponents. Not only is sufficient variety contained in this exponent, but the diatonic-chromatic genus is perfectly suitable for such compositions with composite exponents. Modern composers often use alternation of these modes. common transitions are from mode E major to E minor to C major to A minor and the reverses of these. 

13. This genus of musical works, which is the simplest and thus deserves to be considered the most perfect, is followed by the genus with exponent 2ᵏ·3⁴·5², in which are included all changes of modes and systems commonly used by composers. Thus almost all musical works may be contained in this exponent, if, of course, they are suitably transposed. If one wishes to examine musical works by this pattern, he should not consider the modal changes in themselves, but he should compare their mutual relationship with the mutual relationship of the modes discussed here.

14. The exponent 2ᵏ·3⁴·5² includes in itself the following seven variations of major and minor modes:

2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ)					C Major
2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ·3)				G Major
2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ·5)				E Major
2ⁿ·3³·5(2ᵐ·3·5)				B Major
2ⁿ·3²·5²(2ᵐ)				A Minor
2ⁿ·3²·5²(2ᵐ·3)				E Minor
2ⁿ·3²·5²(2ᵐ·3²)				B Minor

When one contemplates the great richness of species and systems contained in these modes, he will not only wonder at the very great variety in this genus, but he will also recognize that other changes of modes are never used by composers, so that it would be unnecessary to consider more composite exponents.

15. In listing the various modes and systems which can be used in composing a complete composition, we should show what kinds of modes can most suitably be changed among themselves and how the transition from one mode to another should be made. Just as we cannot indiscriminately connect all consonances in the same mode, but only those which are related to each other and produce pleasing successions, so also each transition in a composition from one mode to another should be pleasing.

16. Hence, it follows that two modes in succession should have one or more consonances in common. When such a common consonance is found, it may serve as the intermediate point between two modes, so that the listener is not aware of a leap or unpleasant gap in the music. Moreover, when a pause occurs in the music or when an important division of the composition ends, a new mode can begin. In such case, the pause is considered to fill the place of the common consonance. 

17. Since composers have shown great preference for the harmonic triads contained in the exponent 2ⁿ·3·5 and since a composition consists of their successions, we should consider what modes have such common consonances and what modes can be entered from a given mode. For the sake brevity [sic] we will omit from this investigation powers of 2 in both exponents and indices, since such powers change only the species. 

[table of triads p 344]

18. From the preceding it is clear that it is easy to go from C major to G major or the reverse since these modes ahve two commons triads: 3·5(3) and 3·5(3²). Transition cannot be made from C major to either E major or B major, since there is no common consonance. It is easy to go from C major to A minor since there are two common consonances, 3·5(1) and 3·5(3). It is easy to go from C major to E minor since there are two common triads, 3·5(3) and 3·5(3²). A transition from C major to B minor is more difficult since these modes have only one common consonance, 3·5(3²).

19. Similarly, it is obvious that a transition cannot be made from G major to E major or B major, since there is no common consonance. A transition from C major to A minor would be difficult since there is only one common consonance, 3·5(3), but it is easy to go from G major to E or B minor because of two common consonances. For the same reason, it is easy to go from E major to B major, A minor, or E minor, but it is difficult to go from E major to B minor because there is only one common consonance.

20. It is quite difficult to go from B major to A minor, not only because of the single common consonance, but also because of the excessive difference of the systems. (An explanation of this will be given presently.) However, a transition from B major to E or B minor can be made more easily because of two common consonances. Transition from A minor to E minor is easy but cannot be made from A minor to B minor. It is easy to go from E minor to B minor. THese observations may be summed up in the following table:

[table p 346]

Obviously, it is easy to go from E minor to any of the other modes. 

21. Thus, when two modes have common variations of consonances of the same genus, we have a basis for safe judgment concerning transition from one mode to the other. However, if it happens that two modes have no common species even though they may have common kinds of consonances, then decision should not be made as above. For this reason, we should consider not only the modes in general, as we have done here, but also their species and systems in order that it may be clear whether there are common consonances. By doing this, we may conclude what kind of transition may be admitted and how it can be made.

22. If one bears all these things in mind and examines the process of composing and the works of modern composers, the more he compares, the more agreement he will find. I do not doubt that my theory of music, augmented by true theory now unknown, will furnish expert artists means of advancing this science<fn>An eighteenth century dictionary defines music as "the science of sound, considered as capable of producing melody, or harmony." See Hutton, Charles, _A Mathematical and Philosophical Dictionary_, Vol. II, p. 135.</fn> to a greater degree of perfection.
